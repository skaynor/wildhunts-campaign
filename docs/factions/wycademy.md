# Wycademy

Long ago, the village of Bherna was visited by the Royal Scribes of Paleontology. During the visit, it was discovered the limestone formations around the village contained quantities of fossils of monsters and plants extinct today. From the Royal Paleontology Scriveners investigation and report, the scribes dispatched a small group to set up camp. Over the years scholars focused on laboratory work, leaving field work to hunters, and giving rise to the Wycademy.

## Role of the Wycademy

Originally, the Wycademy was tasked with solving mysteries within the village though that has changed over time. Now the Wycademy is tasked with carrying out research in newly discovered areas in order to clearly define its ecosystem, its geography as well as its fauna and flora. This information is essential so that other groups such as the Hunter's Guild and other corporations like the Elder Dragon Observation Team can work there or establish a small village safe from danger. In order to more easily carry out their research on an area, the Wycademy uses airships for aerial surveillance as well as to quickly drop hunters into the area.

Being a Guild organization, it is also in charge of managing and assigning missions to the hunters who come to this region, which help the organization to obtain information about the new monsters.

More secretly, the Wycademy conducts an exhaustive study of the strange variants of the monsters that have appeared all over the world, called Deviants. Since very little information is known about them and they are very dangerous, they can only be hunted by experienced hunters.


## Hunters of the Wycademy

In order to facilitate the research of scientists in the field, the Wycademy sends specialized hunters to scout to various regions and discover info about known species of monsters. If necessary, the hunters repel or kill the monsters present in the area. They are also sent on urgent missions when it is a question of studying a unidentified species without having for as much needing to kill it; these hunters therefore have, in addition to their hunting talent, a great scientific knowledge.

## Hierarchy of the Wycademy

### Wycademy Director

Directors is the leader of their research facility. The director holds the same rank as a guild manager (many times acting as the guild manager as well), answering only to the guild master's who manage the territory they are in. Beyond bureaucratic work, an academy director is responsible for managing academy teachers, researchers and hunters. The director recruits for replacements when there are open positions. Directors establish performance goals for wycademy personnel, evaluate their performances and coach them throughout the year to help each employee to perform at his best.

### Chief Researcher

A chief researcher knows more than other researchers within their facility. The knowledge they do have is shared freely, including with hunters, unless deemed forbidden by the director. The chief however, doesn't know about some species due the Wycademy council's limited jurisdictions. From this, they are known to ask visitors, or other researchers not from their area, about monsters from faraway lands in order to perform further studies for the Wycademy.

### Researcher

Researcher's have all different types of specializations. Some choose to spend their lives inside the wycademy, continuing research of old, or performing experiments on resources and creatures brought to them by hunters. Other researchers choose to wander into the world, discovering lost ruins, discovering unknown species, or perhaps gathering new knowledge on known species. These field researchers are known to be handlers for hunter groups, or hunters themselves.

### Student

Wycademy students varied in age. Some started their educational journey during childhood, while others who aspired to be hunters arrived at the wycademy after passing the initial hunter exams.

## Wycademy Characters

**Alignment:** Usually neutral  
**Suggested Races:** Any  
**Suggested Classes:** Spellcasters

Consider the Wycademy for your character if one or more of the following sentences ring true:  

- Prying into secrets and mysteries inspires your curiosity.
- You like playing artificers, sorcerer, or wizards.
- You want to make the world a better place through research.

## Joining the Wycademy

Many paths lead people to the Wycademy, all of them guided by the notion that tomorrow can be made better than today. All of the Wycademy's efforts strive to achieve a safer future that they believe is within reach. When you join the Wycademy, choose one of the following roles for your character.

#### Ancient Civilization Researcher

The Ancient Civilization was a once thriving civilization that mysteriously went extinct some centuries ago. You seek to earn the secrets that were lost when this advanced civilization fell. These researchers may spend their time deciphering scrolls in the depths of the Wycademy or travel the world seeking these ruins. Thanks to these researchers weapons with multiple modes and different types of ammunition for the bowguns has been discovered.

#### Endemic Researcher

You choose to study endemic life. This refers broadly to all small lifeforms that inhabit an area. Some endemic life can be used to provide long lasting benefits to hunters on a hunt, or temporary effects that may help or hinder a creature that interacts with them. Your goal is to study these creatures, classifying new endemic life once you determine their effects as one of the following: Hunting Helpers, Ensnaring Life, Craft Creatures, Rare Creatures, Other.

#### Resource Researcher

You choose to research into the natural materials the world provides, attempting to locate unknown resources or ways to make use of known materials (such as earth crystals, thunderbugs, popfish) in different ways. Those who focus on minerals are known as geologists; those who study plants are known as botanists; insects are known as entomologists; fish, ichthyologist; mushrooms, mycologist. If you don't specialize in one type of resource, you are known as a naturalist.

#### Monster Researcher

Monster researchers are split into two different types. The zoologist studies known creatures by observing various species in their habitats, zoologists understand how animals behave in the wild. Their goal is to identify and monitor how different species interact within their ecosystem. This is particularly important as many species continues to transform various habitats.

A researcher who searches for and studies unknown, legendary, or extinct animals whose present existence is disputed or unsubstantiated is known as a cryptozoologist. These researchers spend their time in the field almost exclusively seeking rumors of unknown creatures or traveling to some of the most dangerous areas in the world to find what lives there.

Discuss with your DM what that amount is and if you can make more depending on what you discover or as you level up.

## How do I Fit In?

As a member of the Wycademy, your primary goal is to carry out research in any area you are in order to clearly note changes its ecosystem, its geography as well as its fauna and flora. Due to this, you are expected to keep tabs on the monster populations in areas and report any strange events to the Wycademy and the Hunter's Guild. As a member of the Wycademy, you will spend time between compiling your research during down time to send to the Wycademy and joining hunters on hunts, as one of the members of the party or possibly as a handler. A hunter initiate is the core role in the hunters guild where you might strive to become like one of the hunters of legends, or perhaps to seek to preserve the balance in nature. It is not uncommon for you to take the scout role on a hunt. Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable- whether learning a new spell or discovering a new technology to use - gives the Wycademy and hunters a more efficient way to hunt.

### A Wycademy Party

An adventuring party is rarely ever made up of only Wycademy members. Typically parties will have one or two Wycademy members with members of the Hunter's Guild filling the rest of the parties roles.

## Rank and Renown

A member of the Wycademy gains renown typically when they make a new discovery, be it an unknown species, information about a known species, information about the ancient civilization, or some new use for a resource, etc. By gaining renown as a member of the Wycademy, your course of advancement leads to increased responsibility. Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of the Wycademy Director. Advancement is a reward for services rendered to the Wycademy, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

### Rank 1: Junior Researcher

*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Wycademy*

As a junior researcher, you are responsible for evaluating and interpreting scientific results from laboratory investigations and experiments. Junior researcher assist the senior researchers in gathering information to support research studies and claims. You perform both laboratory and field trials to collect samples for further examinations. Such errands can bring you into contact with members of other guilds and lead to adventures.

While completing a task that requires you to stay away from home for a period of a week or longer, your senior researcher may provide you a modest living wage until you return.

### Rank 2: Researcher

*Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Wycademy*

After doing your time as a junior researcher, you are eligible to lead your own experiments. You must be associated with a project, and must work on experiments related to its primary focus under the general guidance of the senior researcher. Senior researchers are more hands-on, ensuring that your research contributes to reaching the immediate objective. Your chief researcher may check in from time to time, but they give you wide latitude to pursue your own experiments under the general aegis of the Wycademy's interests.

If your research requires it, your senior researcher or chief researcher can provide you with specific materials related to advancing the project before you undertake a mission or an experiment. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to checks related to your role within the wycademy.

### Rank 3: Senior Researcher

*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Wycademy*

A proven researcher, you are eligible to oversee your own project, directing the efforts of other researchers toward the solution of some problem facing the Wycademy or Hunter's Guild. The director of your institution gives you laboratory space, and you have a staff of 3d12 researchers (which use the stat blocks of commoners from the Monster Manual). You can have this staff work on projects for you, which can include downtime actions.

Hosting the work of a successful and important project reflects well on your director, so they keep a close eye on your work. On the positive side, you can count on access to the considerable resources of the director as long as your research is going well. On the other hand, you can expect your director to expect constant updates (by way of the sending spell if you are in the field) to ensure that your efforts remain relevant to the overall goals of the Wycademy.

### Rank 4: Chief Researcher

*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 50 or higher in the Wycademy*

As a famous researcher or a successful project leader, you stand ready to take on a supervisory role for an entire institution. New Wycademy locations are rarely built, so you must wait for your chief researcher to retire before a position exists for you to fill, except in truly exceptional circumstances. Similar to a project leader, you are responsible for directing the efforts of researchers exploring a wide variety of projects related to the focus of the Wycademy. Unless an experiment turns out to be especially interesting, these efforts can carry on without your supervision. If you need to, you can enlist the aid of 5d12 researchers (which use the stat blocks of commoners from the Monster Manual), and you can also request the support of Hunter's Guild members from the guild manager of any Hunter's Guild in a town where the members of your institution live and work.

### Wycademy Director (Special Role)

*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Wycademy*

You are eligible to become the Director of a Wycademy institution. The selection of a new Director (in the event of an existing Speaker's retiring, dying, or otherwise leaving the position) takes place through a combination of popular election and the input of the other Wycademy Directors, with the His Immenseness having the final word. If you emerge as the victor after this rigorous process, you assume the leadership of your Wycademy and are empowered to bring its concerns before His Immenseness.

You are a political leader rather than a scientific one, so you have authority over other members of the combine only if they live and work in your area. If an institution has a laboratory in your area, you have the right (and responsibility) to supervise its activities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but not to interfere in its research beyond that point. And if the chief researcher lives in a different area, you have no authority whatsoever over that person.

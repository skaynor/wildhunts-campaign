# The Factions of Monster Hunter

There are many factions in the Monster Hunter Universe. Some of them make up the foundation of society, while others seek to destroy it. Many of these factions are voluntary associations led by guildmasters, but that’s the extent of their resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found in most Dungeons & Dragons worlds.

The denizens of the Old World aren't born into factions. An individual can choose to belong to any, or be tricked into some faction or more commonly belong to no faction at all. Some Factions actively recruit new members, while others simply accept those who seek membership. People within a family might join different factions, which can lead to strong connections between the factions in question or to painful animosity in families whose members follow different paths.

## Faction Membership

You establish your character's membership in a faction by choosing one of their faction backgrounds from among those detailed in this section. This guide assumes that you have chosen a faction and that you maintain your association with it throughout your life. As a result, your choice of faction can play a more significant role than most backgrounds do in shaping what your character does now.

The backgrounds associated with factions in this section work like those in the Player's Handbook, giving you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws). Each faction entry also provides personal contacts; suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a member of a spellcasting class.

### Faction Spells

The spellcasters of the Old World's factions have magic specific to their guild. A faction's description includes a list of faction spells.

If you play a character who has the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your guild spells are added to the spell list for your class, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.

### Additional Rules

 The factions in the Monster Hunter Universe use the same rules for renown and contacts as found in [The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lkLJocy27qWAJmbRPyNwg-tdxBS5KwW/view?usp=drive_link) starting on page 29.

#### Contacts

Contacts are people you know. They might be a rival, a mentor, a friend, just another member of the faction or possibly a member of a different faction entirely. These contacts should be created with your DM and may provide additional depth for your character. When you create a character you have a number of contacts equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

#### Renown

Renown is your status in a faction. The higher your renown is, typically the more known and respected you are within the faction. It's also possible to gain renown in other factions, though this renown won't allow you to gain any ranks within the other factions.

To gain renown you must advance the guild’s agenda in some way. You will find in the Rank and Renown section of each faction, some suggestions that would merit an increase in your renown, but you should also check the goals of the faction to help determine other ways to gain renown. When you join a faction as a starting character, your renown score with that faction is 1. It is up to the DM when you gain renown, not the player.

There are other rules for gaining renown outside of the list above, but that can be found in [The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lkLJocy27qWAJmbRPyNwg-tdxBS5KwW/view?usp=drive_link)

#### Benefits of Renown

There are many benefits when you gain renown in a faction, most often it is tied to an increase in rank within the faction you are in, but not all are guild specific such as the two below:

***Renown 3 or Higher.*** You have established yourself as a respected member of the guild and as such, the guild members are friendly to you by default (though some members might have a reason to dislike you).

***Renown 5 or Higher.*** You gain another contact. This might be a member of your faction, or perhaps someone else you met on your adventures.

#### Losing Renown

If you go against your faction, or commit a crime against society or nature, you might lose renown. It is up to the DM to determine how much based on the offense. You cannot drop below 0 renown with a faction, but if your renown drops below the required amount for your rank, then you lose the rank and any benefits it gave you. It also may be much harder to obtain that rank again.

#### Changing Factions

If for some reason you chose to change factions, be it due to the narrative of the story, or some other reason, you then lose all renown with your previous faction and start with 0 renown with the new faction. The only exception with this is if you already gained renown with the new faction prior to joining them. Then instead you start with the renown you already had with them, though it may still take time for you to rise in the ranks.

## Factions in this Campaign

You will start your journey as a Hunter Initiate in the Hunter's Guild. If you wish for your character to be apart of another faction prior to that then that is allowed, but I will only allow you to gain the stat benefits from one of the Factions (if you don't choose another faction you will automatically gain the benefits only from the Hunter's Guild). Next are entries for all of the factions, starting with the Hunter's Guild.

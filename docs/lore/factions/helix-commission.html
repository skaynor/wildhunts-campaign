<p>In the world, there is an organization shrouded in secrecy known as the Helix Commission. The origins of this group are unknown, but some believe it was created by a faction of Wycademy researchers and royal scriveners who discovered an ancient incomplete Equal Dragon Weapon in the ruins of an ancient civilization research lab. It has been said that a few lead scientists and researchers within this faction became interested in following in the footsteps of the ancient civilization and began experimenting with creating hybrids of monsters. However, their requests to conduct this research were denied by the leaders of the ruling factions, who wished to keep this information secret.</p>
<p>Despite being denied permission, these scientists and researchers continued their research in secret. They created a number of new hybrid monsters, some of which may be the subspecies, variants, and deviants we see today. But eventually, their experiments were discovered by the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, who raided their labs and destroyed their work. Those who managed to escape the raid formed the Helix Commission, an organization dedicated to continuing their research in secret and away from the prying eyes of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, Wycademy, and Royal Scriveners.</p>
<p>The Helix Commission is known to experiment with genetic engineering and hybridization, and rumors persist that they are responsible for the creation of many of the subspecies of monsters that exist in the world today. Despite their secrecy, some brave hunters have managed to infiltrate the Helix Commission&#x27;s lairs and retrieve valuable information about their research. But even with this knowledge, the true goals and motivations of the Helix Commission remain shrouded in mystery.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="role-of-the-helix-commission">Role of the Helix Commission<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Role of the Helix Commission" title="Direct link to Role of the Helix Commission" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#role-of-the-helix-commission">​</a></h2>
<p>The Helix Commission is dedicated to studying and experimenting with the creation of hybrid monsters by combining two different species. They believe that these hybrids could have incredible potential, both for scientific understanding and practical application. Their ultimate goal is to create new, more powerful species that could be harnessed to benefit humanity. However, this research is considered illegal by the Hunter&#x27;s Guild and immoral by both the Royal Scriveners and Wycademy. Despite this, the Helix Commission continues to work tirelessly towards their goal of creating hybrid monsters that can benefit the world.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="methods-of-the-helix-commission">Methods of the Helix Commission<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Methods of the Helix Commission" title="Direct link to Methods of the Helix Commission" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#methods-of-the-helix-commission">​</a></h2>
<p>In order to conduct their research, the Helix Commission works outside of the expected norms of the world. They perform these experiments in secret, in hidden laboratories scattered throughout the world. They also employ a team of skilled hunters to retrieve the necessary samples and conduct experiments. The process of creating hybrids is complex and risky, often resulting in dangerous and unpredictable creatures. Nonetheless, the Helix Commission believes that the benefits of their research far outweigh the risks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="members-of-the-helix-commission">Members of the Helix Commission<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Members of the Helix Commission" title="Direct link to Members of the Helix Commission" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#members-of-the-helix-commission">​</a></h2>
<p>The members of the Helix Commission are scientists who have left the Royal Scriveners or Wycademy for a variety of reasons. They are driven by a desire to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge, even if it means breaking the law or operating outside the norms of society. Some members are former hunters who became disillusioned with the Hunter&#x27;s Guild and its strict code of ethics.</p>
<p>Scientists of the Helix Commission have all different types of specializations. Some choose to spend their lives inside the organization, continuing research of old or performing experiments on the creatures brought to them by their hunters. Other researchers choose to venture into the world, discovering new species or gathering new knowledge on known species.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hierarchy-of-the-helix-commission">Hierarchy of the Helix Commission<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hierarchy of the Helix Commission" title="Direct link to Hierarchy of the Helix Commission" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#hierarchy-of-the-helix-commission">​</a></h2>

<p>The Director is the leader of the research facility. They are the driving force behind the group&#x27;s research. They oversee all experiments and are responsible for making the final decision on which species to hybridize. The leader is highly respected among the members of the group and is seen as the ultimate authority on all matters related to their research.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lead-scientist">Lead Scientist<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lead Scientist" title="Direct link to Lead Scientist" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#lead-scientist">​</a></h3>
<p>Lead scientists are the most experienced and knowledgeable members of the Helix Commission. They have extensive knowledge of the genetic makeup of monsters and are responsible for designing the experiments that create hybrids. They work closely with the director of their facility to ensure that their research stays on track.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scientist">Scientist<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scientist" title="Direct link to Scientist" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#scientist">​</a></h3>
<p>Scientists have all different types of specializations. They are responsible for conducting experiments, analyzing data, and sharing their findings with the rest of the Helix Commission. They may also accompany hunters into the field to collect samples or conduct experiments on live subjects.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="agent">Agent<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Agent" title="Direct link to Agent" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/lore/factions/helix-commission#agent">​</a></h3>
<p>The Agent role within the Helix Commission is responsible for overseeing the practical implementation of the Commission&#x27;s research and development projects. This includes recruiting hunters and mercenaries to aid in the collection of research specimens, coordinating with the Commission&#x27;s scientists to ensure that the necessary equipment and personnel are in place for field research, and liaising with external organizations to procure any additional resources or support that may be required.</p>
<p>Agents are typically skilled hunters or mercenaries who possess a deep understanding of monster ecology and behavior. They work closely with the Commission&#x27;s researchers to identify and locate specimens, and often engage in dangerous missions to capture or eliminate specimens that are deemed too dangerous or unstable for further research.</p>
<p>Additionally, Agents may also act as enforcers for the Commission&#x27;s strict confidentiality policies, ensuring that any sensitive information or technology is kept strictly secret and out of the hands of rival organizations or factions.</p>
<p>Overall, the Agent role within the Helix Commission is a crucial link between the Commission&#x27;s scientific research and the practical implementation of that research in the field.</p>

<p>There are several ways to join the Commission. The main way is being recruited by the Commission themselves, as they keep an eye out for potential bright minds who might be willing to work for them. It is not uncommon for invitations to be sent out in this way. Another way would be encountering one of the escaped monsters of the commission, and helping take care of it before it could hurt others, proving their worth. The final way is being a convict of some kind, like poachers or criminals, as the commission always need expendable minions.</p>

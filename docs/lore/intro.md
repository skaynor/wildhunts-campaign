# HELP

This is a brief summary of the portions of [Guide to Monster Hunting](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCk9FgQaqaXBVmLeCeT) by [Amellwind](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amellwind/) used in the Preyline campaign. 

This website is not a direct replacement to the original guide, but a collection of information important to character creation and other aspects of this campaign.

## Getting Started

Character creation is done using the traditional system from the official [Player's Handbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10elvJ7bM_YyGaGt_xAIZFyr9aGkBPpEu&usp=drive_fs).


Worldbuilding related character traits, such as race, background, and faction affiliation are modified to fit into the Monster Hunter canon, but the goal is not to copy the games 1-for-1. As with most 5e campaigns, magic is present in this world and while this keeps the option open to build a spellcasting focused character, you're missing the point of a Monster Hunter campaign if you're going to throw magic missiles at everything you encounter.

Classes remain untouched (with a few exceptions) but all standard weapons are replaced by a Monster Hunter weapon (nearly all official with a couple homebrew ones added by the author). Selection of your weapon is in some ways just as important as selection of your class, as each enable you to unlock weapon related feats and determine what materials you can use to augment your abilities. The extra stats provided by these weapon and armor changes allow you to properly take on the monster encounters in this campaign.

:::tip Homebrew
Any and all homebrew is welcome, as long as you run it by the GM first. Much of this campaign and the systems are a work in progress and will be even during the duration of the campaign, if you have something you want to try out or add don't hesitate to bring it up.

:::danger WARNING
If you make a spellcaster I will try to kill you.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves, first let's introduce you to the new mechanics in Monster Hunter 5e.

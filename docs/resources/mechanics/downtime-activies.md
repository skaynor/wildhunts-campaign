# Downtime Activities

When you aren't out of quests or progressing the plot, there are plenty of new downtime activities to fill your time.

## Solo Hunt

Sometimes it is easier to hunt alone. This activity gives a character the chance to obtain some extra materials from creatures.

**Resources.** This activity requires one workweek of effort plus 100 gp to pay for research and supplies to hunt a medium. A character can hunt a hard encounter for 150 gp to cover expenses, or 200 gp for a deadly encounter.

**Resolution.** The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks determined by the difficulty of the encounter. The chosen DC for medium is equal to the creature’s carve DC. A hard encounter is the creature’s carve DC +3 and deadly is the creature’s carve DC +6. Successful completion of the hunt yields a number of materials, as shown on the Loot Value table.

To attempt a Hunt, the character makes three checks: Wisdom (Perception), Intelligence (Investigation), and the player's choice of Wisdom (Survival), Dexterity (Stealth), or Strength (Athletics).

If none of the checks are successful, the character is severely injured and hospitalized. The injured character must spend one week in the hospital for every 50g of the initial cost of the hunt.

If only one check is successful, the hunt fails but the character escapes.

If two checks are successful, the hunt is a partial success, netting the character one material from the creature. Roll on the loot table to determine which.

If all three checks are successful, the character earns three materials from the creature. Roll on the loot table for each material to determine which materials are obtained.

:::tip Solo Hunt Table
The table in the [Guide to Monster Hunting](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCk9FgQaqaXBVmLeCeT) (p.55) shows the maximum CR a character can hunt depending on their level and difficulty they choose. Once they choose their difficulty, they can then pick the creature they are hunting.

## Trenya

Trenya travels to various regions in his boat. A character can travel with Trenya on adventures. Trenya can help gather items for hunters, some of which can only be obtained through him. Trenya is a great way to gather materials for upgrading weapons and armor.

**Resources.** This activity requires one workweek of effort and the character chooses the location for the adventure. The character has a choice between these locations: snowy mountains, jungle, desert, or swamp. Once the location is set, the character pays Trenya 200gp, 500gp, or 1500gp.

**Resolution.** Depending on the location and how much the character spent they will need to make a number of checks; a Strength (Athletics) check, a Dexterity (Stealth) check, an Intelligence (Investigation) check, a Wisdom (Perception) check, and a Charisma (Intimidation, Persuasion, or Deception) check. The character can only use each skill once and once they fail a check the adventure is over and they return home.

If only one check is successful, the character rolls on the general section of the table.

If two checks are successful, the character rolls on the first and second level of the table.

If three checks are successful, the character rolls on the first, second, and third level of the table.

If four checks are successful, the character rolls on the fourth and below levels of the table. If there is no fourth level or higher, the character may roll once again on a previous level.

If all five checks are successful, the character rolls on each level of the table. If there is no fifth level, the character may roll once again on a previous level.

> *Some of the items listed on Trenya loot tables do not yet have a purpose. Either the creature's loot table has not been created as of yet, their purpose has not yet been determined, or they are junk that only has a gold value.*

## Sell Materials

Selling materials can be a difficult task at times. Demand is not always there and even if you have a legitimate buyer for one you may still not get the price you are expecting.

**Resources.** A character can find a buyer for a specific material by spending one workweek and 25gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character can pick up to 10 materials at a time to sell.

**Resolution.** A character who wants to sell materials must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Material Base Price and Material Item Offer tables below to determine the sale price.

#### Material Base Price
| Creatures CR Level | Base Price* |
| :----------------: | :---------: |
| 0-3                | 25 gp       |
| 4-8                | 100 gp      |
| 9-13               | 500 gp      |
| 14-19              | 2,000 gp    |
| 20+                | 4,000 gp    |

\**All materials are the same price from a creature based on its CR level.*

#### Material Item Offer
| Check Total | Offer              |
| :---------: | :---:              |
| 1-10        | 50% of base price  |
| 11-20       | 100% of base price |
| 21+         | 150% of base price |

## Palico Farm

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime collecting resources at the palico farm.

**Resources.** This activity requires access to a farm run by
felyne and melynx (typically found in any village or town), one
workweek of effort plus a cost of 25 gp for access to the farm
and tools required for the work.

**Resolution.** Choose a location stat block appropriate for
your level or lower, and the area you are in. The character
then chooses three resources to collect between: fish, insects,
mushroom, or plants. The character can pick the same
resource multiple times, but they cannot pick a resource that
is not on the location stat block they chose. The character
then makes three skill checks, one for each resource they
chose. The DC is equal to the resource DC in the location
stat block.

The type of check they make depends on the resource they
are attempting to obtain. For fish, they make a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. For insects,
they make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Nature)
check. For mushrooms, they make a Wisdom (Nature) or
Wisdom (Survival) check. For plants, they make a Wisdom
(Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

For each successful check, the character rolls on the
location stat blocks resource table, gaining the resource
listed.

**Complications.** Complications while farming usually relate
to the maintenance of the tools to gather the resources.
Whenever a character starts a workweek on the palico farm,
there is a 10 percent chance of one of the tools being
unavailable due to maintenance. Roll on the complication
table to determine why certain resources can't be collected
this workweek.

| d4  | Complication |
| :-: | :----------- |
| 1   | The Fishing Pole is broken, a new one won't arrive for a workweek. The character can't collect fish. |
| 2   | The bugnet is filled with more holes than actual netting. The character can't collect insects. |
| 3   | The fields were just seeded, there are currently no plants to collect. |
| 4   | A mosswine got into the mushroom cave and ate every last mushroom. The character can't collect mushrooms to do this. |

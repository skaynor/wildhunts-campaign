# Hunts

## Your Role on a Hunt

When your party goes on a hunt or heads out on an expedition, you choose a role from the ones detailed below. Each role can be only chosen by one character, except for the spotter role.

Sometimes the party may split up. When split into groups of two the only roles available are the trailblazer and spotter.

*If someone is alone, they are both the trailblazer and spotter, but they either have to choose to take disadvantage on their survival roll for finding signs or take a -4 to their passive perception.*

## Trailblazer

*Primary Skill: Survival*

The trailblazer is the leader of the group and is the one who makes the final decision on which direction the group should go on a hunt. Whenever the group enters an area (new or old), the trailblazer rolls a survival check vs the creatures carve DC. On a failure the GM rolls a d10 on the finding signs table (found in the Going on a Hunt section in chapter 4), on a success the GM rolls a d20 instead. On a critical, the GM rolls a 2d20 and takes the highest roll, on a nat 1 the GM rolls 2d10 and takes the lowest roll.

## Spotter

*Primary Skill: passive Perception*

The spotter uses their passive perception to scope out for any ambushes or dangers missed initially by the scout. There can be 2 spotters, the 2nd spotter gives a +4 perception bonus to the other, but does not provide any bonus to the original spotter's passive investigation.

*(Optional Rule)* If your DM chooses to allow passive Investigations (10+ investigation skill bonus), then the spotter is also able to find resources in an area without needing to make an Intelligence (Investigation) to find them. A spotter is able to spot resources with their passive Investigation, only if it is higher than the investigation DC of the area they are in. Finally, a second spotter does not provide any bonus to the spotters passive Investigation.

## Scout

*Primary Skill: Perception, Stealth*

The scout is the initial person who enters an area, they get the lay of the land, potential resources, creatures in the area, potential hazards. When a scout notices a potential spot for an ambush it gives the spotter a +4 bonus to their perception.

## Artisan

*Primary Skill: Cooking Utensils, Three highest Ability Scores*

The artisan can cook a meal for the party at the start of a hunt and during a short or long rest (if they choose to), granting all who eat it a boon to help them on their hunt/journey/day.

### How to cook a meal

#### Step 1.

When getting ready to cook a meal as an artisan, the first step is to decide on what you want to cook and ensuring you have the ingredients required for the meal. On the next page you will find a list of tables with meal names, ingredients, the DC required to cook the meal, and the boon they grant.

The ingredients themselves should be easy to obtain. They might find them near the campsite as part of preparing the meal or be able to purchase them in town for under 1 sp for a portion large enough to prepare a meal for a party of four.

#### Step 2.

There are multiple steps in creating a meal; *deciding on the recipe/what to cook, gathering ingredients, preparing the ingredients, cooking the meal, plating it properly.*

Choose three of the steps from the list above and one of the six main ability scores for each step. You cannot use the same ability score on different steps. Then describe how you use that ability score for the step you chose and make an ability score check. The DM may impose disadvantage on the check if the description is wildly improbable to work or not allow the roll.

#### Step 3.

Once the player has made their three checks, take the average of the checks and compare them to the DC of the meal they are attempting to make.

On a successful check the meal counts as a days ration for any who eat it and they gain the boon the meal provides. If the artisan succeeds by 4 or more, roll once on the daily skill list. If they succeed by 8 or more, roll twice on the daily skill list.

On a failed check it becomes a bland meal and counts as 1 days ration. If the artisan fails the check by 5 or more, it does not count as a ration and any creature who eats the meal must succeed on a Constitution saving throw equal to the meals DC or become poisoned for 1 hour.

### Ingredient Cost

There is always a cost when cooking a meal. Wether you use your supplies to go out and collect local foliage and fauna or purchase it in the market. The cost of preparing a meal depends on its rank. A Rank 1 meal costs 1 sp; Rank 2 meals, 1 gp; Rank 3 meals, 5 gp; and Rank 4 meals, 10 gp.

### Cooking higher ranked meals

More recipes will become available to you as you increase your hunter rank.

You are able to cook rank 2 meals at 5th level, rank 3 meals at 10th level, rank 4 meals at 15th level.

# Hunts

## Your Role on a Hunt

When your party goes on a hunt or heads out on an expedition, you choose a role from the ones detailed below. Each role can be chosen multiple times, but some of their tasks can not be done multiple times, such as the trailblazer's Survival checks per area.

Sometimes the party may split up. When split into groups of two, the only roles available are trailblazer and spotter.

*If someone is alone, they are both the trailblazer and spotter, but they either have to choose to take disadvantage on their survival roll for finding signs or take a -4 to their passive perception.*

## Trailblazer

*Primary Skill: Survival*

The trailblazer is the leader of the group and is the one who makes the final decision on which direction the group should go on a hunt. Whenever the group enters an area (new or old), the trailblazer rolls a Survival check vs the creature's carve DC. On a failure, the GM rolls a d10 on the [finding signs table](resources/appendix/finding-signs-table.md), on a success the GM rolls a d20 instead. On a critical, the GM rolls a 2d20 and takes the highest roll; on a nat 1 the GM rolls 2d10 and takes the lowest roll.

:::note Additional Trailblazers
You may have multiple trailblazers, but only one may make the Survival check per area. Each additional trailblazer provides a +2 bonus to the Survival check, and for every 3 trailblazers, a +1 to the GM's roll on the finding signs table.
:::

## Spotter

*Primary Skill: passive Perception, Investigation*

The spotter uses their passive Perception or passive Investigation (10 + Investigation skill bonus) to scope out for any ambushes or dangers missed initially by the scout. There can be 2 spotters; the 2nd spotter gives a +4 Perception bonus to the other, but does not provide any bonus to the original spotter's passive Investigation. 

Spotters are also responsible for finding any harvestable resources in a given area. A spotter makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the the Investigation DC of the area they are in, finding resources on a success. If they are already using their passive Investigation, this is used instead for resource checks against the Investigation DC.

:::note Additional Spotters
Additional spotters do not add to any of the bonuses. However, additional spotters can attempt their own Perception or Investigation checks, and each pair of additional spotters can do so with the +4 Perception bonus.
:::

## Scout

*Primary Skill: Perception, Stealth*

The scout is the initial person who enters an area; they get the lay of the land, potential resources, creatures in the area, and potential hazards. 

The scout makes both a Wisdom (Perception) and a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the Navigation DC of the area. On a successful Perception check, the scout is aware of the number and position of creatures in the area, as well as providing the Spotter with a +4 to their passive Perception or passive Investigation. On a successful Stealth check, the scout is able to gather this information and return to their party without alerting any of the creatures in the area. If the scout fails the Stealth check, creatures might flee or possibly attack the scout while they are separated from their party.

:::note Additional Scouts
You can have multiple scouts, adding +4 to the Perception check for each additional scout. However, each scout must pass their Stealth check or risk being spotted by the monsters in the area.
:::

:::tip Hiding Creatures
Some creatures might be intentionally hiding or already hidden from the view of the scout. The scout is only aware of these creatures if their Perception check is greater than the creature's Stealth roll.

## Artisan

*Primary Skill: Cooking Utensils, Three highest Ability Scores*

The artisan can cook a meal for the party at the start of a hunt and during a short or long rest (if they choose to), granting all who eat it a boon to help them on their hunt/journey/day.

:::note Additional Artisans
You can have additional Artisans, but each party member can only benefit from one meal at a time, and each artisan must individually gather or pay for their ingredients.
:::

### How to Cook a Meal

#### Step 1.

When getting ready to cook a meal as an artisan, the first step is to decide on what you want to cook and ensure you have the ingredients required for the meal. 

The ingredients themselves should be easy to obtain. They might find them near the campsite as part of preparing the meal or be able to purchase them in town for under 1 sp for a portion large enough to prepare a meal for a party of four.

#### Step 2.

There are multiple steps in creating a meal: *deciding on the recipe/what to cook, gathering ingredients, preparing the ingredients, cooking the meal, and plating it properly.*

Choose three of the steps from the list above (or create your own) and one of the six main ability scores for each step. You cannot use the same ability score on different steps. Then describe how you use that ability score for the step you chose and make an ability score check. The DM may impose disadvantage on the check if the description is wildly improbable to work or not allow the roll.

:::tip Cooking Utensils
A creature that has cooking utensils and is proficient with them, can add their proficiency bonus to one of the three ability score checks.
:::

#### Step 3.

Once the player has made their three checks, take the average of the checks and compare them to the DC of the meal they are attempting to make.

On a successful check, the meal counts as a day's ration for anyone who eats it, and they gain the boon the meal provides. If the artisan succeeds by 4 or more, roll once on the daily skill list. If they succeed by 8 or more, roll twice on the daily skill list.

On a failed check, it becomes a bland meal and counts as 1 day's ration. If the artisan fails the check by 5 or more, it does not count as a ration, and any creature who eats the meal must succeed on a Constitution saving throw equal to the meals DC or become poisoned for 1 hour.

### Ingredient Cost

There is always a cost when cooking a meal. Whether you use your supplies to go out and collect local foliage and fauna or purchase them at a market, the cost of preparing a meal depends on its rank. A Rank 1 meal costs 1 sp; Rank 2 meals, 1 gp; Rank 3 meals, 5 gp; and Rank 4 meals, 10 gp.

### Cooking Higher Ranked Meals

More recipes will become available to you as you increase your hunter rank.

You are able to cook Rank 2 meals at 5th level, Rank 3 meals at 10th level, Rank 4 meals at 15th level.

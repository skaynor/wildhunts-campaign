# Hunts

## Your Role on a Hunt

In Monster Hunter 5e, parties are divided into roles: the trailblazer, the scout, the spotter, and the artisan. However, for this campaign we will only be concerned with anyone who wants to fill the role of artisan, as no party is complete without a chef.

## Artisan

**Primary Skill:** *Cooking Utensils, Three highest Ability Scores*

The artisan can cook a meal for the party during a short or long rest (if they choose to), granting all who eat it a boon to help them on their hunt/journey/day.

:::note Additional Artisans
You can have additional Artisans, but each party member can only benefit from one meal at a time, and each artisan must individually gather or pay for their ingredients.

### How to Cook a Meal

#### Step 1

When getting ready to cook a meal as an artisan, the first step is to decide on what you want to cook and ensure you have the ingredients required for the meal. 

The ingredients themselves should be easy to obtain. They might find them near the campsite as part of preparing the meal or be able to purchase them in town for under 1 sp for a portion large enough to prepare a meal for a party of four.

#### Step 2

There are multiple steps in creating a meal: *deciding on the recipe/what to cook, gathering ingredients, preparing the ingredients, cooking the meal, and plating it properly.*

Choose three of the steps from the list above (or create your own) and one of the six main ability scores for each step. You cannot use the same ability score on different steps. Then describe how you use that ability score for the step you chose and make an ability score check. The DM may impose disadvantage on the check if the description is wildly improbable to work or not allow the roll.

A creature that has cooking utensils and is proficient with them, can add their proficiency bonus to one of the three ability score checks.

#### Step 3

Once the player has made their three checks, take the average of the checks and compare them to the DC of the meal they are attempting to make.

On a successful check, the meal counts as a day's ration for anyone who eats it, and they gain the boon the meal provides. If the artisan succeeds by 4 or more, roll once on the daily skill list. If they succeed by 8 or more, roll twice on the daily skill list.

On a failed check, it becomes a bland meal and counts as 1 day's ration. If the artisan fails the check by 5 or more, it does not count as a ration, and any creature who eats the meal must succeed on a Constitution saving throw equal to the meals DC or become poisoned for 1 hour.

### Ingredient Cost

There is always a cost when cooking a meal. Whether you use your supplies to go out and collect local foliage and fauna or purchase them at a market, the cost of preparing a meal depends on its rank. A Rank 1 meal costs 1 sp; Rank 2 meals, 1 gp; Rank 3 meals, 5 gp; and Rank 4 meals, 10 gp.

### Cooking Higher Ranked Meals

More recipes will become available to you as you increase your hunter rank.

You are able to cook Rank 2 meals at 5th level, Rank 3 meals at 10th level, Rank 4 meals at 15th level.

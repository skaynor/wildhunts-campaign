## Shops

There is a wide variety for shops in monster hunter, the most common of them are the Provision Stockpile, the Smithy, and the General Store. Items and services that can normally be found at these shops will be generalized to fit the setting of the campaign.

## Selling Materials

Selling material can be a difficult task at times. Demand is not always there and even if you have a legitimate buyer for one you may still not get the price you are expecting.

### Resources

A character can find a buyer for a specific material by spending one day and 25gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character can pick up to 20 materials to sell at a time.

### Resolution

A character who wants to sell materials must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Material Base Price and Material Item Offer tables below to determine the sale price.

#### Material Base Price

| Creatures CR level | Base Price* |
| :-:                | :-:       |
| 0-3                | 25 gp     |
| 4-8                | 100 gp    |
| 9-13               | 500 gp    |
| 14-19              | 2,000 gp  |
| 20+                | 4,000 gp  |

* *All materials are the same price from a creature base on its CR level.*

#### Material Item Offer

| Check Total | Offer |
| :-:         | :-:   |
| 1-10        | 50% of base price  |
| 11-20       | 100% of base price |
| 21+         | 150% of base price |

## Combo List

Many of the items found in the Monster Hunter Universe can be crafted using resources and materials found during your travels. Below you will find lists of items you can make with each tool, the required ingredients, how difficult it will be to make, and how much is created on a successful crafting check. Some crafting materials will be generalized for this campaign, as things such as "Monster Bone" or "Monster Hide" are not as common on a space station.

An item may appear more than once on any given list, requiring a different combination of items to craft. An item may also appear under two or more tools, in which case you may choose which tool you use to craft it.

### Using the Combo List

Any PC can create any of the items in the combo list so long as they have the tool required. **They do not need to be proficient with the tool.**

To craft an item from the combo list, the PC chooses the item they wish to create. So long as they have the tool, the required items, and enough time *(determined by the DM)* to create the item; then the PC makes a crafting check.

**Crafting Check:** 1d20 + your ability score modifier + your proficiency bonus *(if they are proficient with the tool)*.

On a successful crafting check, the required items are consumed and the item is crafted. If the crafting check fails by 5 or less, only 1 of the required items (PC's choice) is consumed. If they fail the check by 6 or more, both required items are consumed.

### Not sure what Ability Score to Use?

Tools are not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. A player can make a case to their DM on which ability score to use, but sometimes a DM may not agree or might be unsure on which ability score to have the PC use. If you are unsure of what skill to use, both Wisdom or Intelligence are great options to use.

Wisdom can be viewed as experience or natural talent with the tool. Think of it like a baker who doesn't measure their ingredients for a cake and adapts the recipe to what they think it should be, and the cake still ends up tasting amazing. While Intelligence can be used for the PC's retained knowledge or ability to follow instructions. This is the baker who follows the exact directions and the cake comes out exactly as expected.

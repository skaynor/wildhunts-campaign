In a galaxy stitched together by the rusting bones of forgotten empires, civilization endures in the shadow of machines no one remembers how to build and systems no one truly understands. Cities cling to life within crumbling arcologies, trade flows through derelict space lanes, and deep beneath the surface, remnants of lost eras pulse with unstable power. Knowledge is fragmented, myth and data often indistinguishable, and every discovery carries riskâ€”of awakening, of corruption, of consequence. It is a time of slow collapse and quiet resilience, where survival is an act of defiance, and the future belongs to those bold enough to reclaim it.

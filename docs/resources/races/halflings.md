# Halflings

Halfling clans have long been recognized for their intense curiosity and habit of collecting anything that catches their eye. In the era before the collapse of the old civilizations, they were foremost experts in the study of plant life, fungi, and natural compounds. Their small size and sharp senses made them ideal field researchers and herbalists, leading expeditions into remote, often dangerous zones to gather rare biological materials. Their work wasn’t just for academic interest—it frequently contributed to medicine, environmental restoration, and the enhancement of life for both organic and synthetic beings.

When global tensions fractured the world, the halfling clans split according to differing philosophies. The Lightfoot clan chose to avoid direct involvement in conflict, dedicating themselves to supporting others through medicine and environmental research. The Stoutfoot took a more militant stance, with adult members engaging in frontline defense while younger members served as scouts and guardians of their communities. A third group, which came to be known as the Forgefoot, abandoned their traditional botanical focus entirely, turning their attention toward manipulating geology and developing tools to reshape terrain and reinforce infrastructure in hazardous environments.

Even after stability began to return to parts of the world, the halfling clans did not reunite. The Lightfoots remained staunch traditionalists, continuing their ecological work and expressing disdain toward the other clans for diverging from what they considered the “true path.” The Stoutfoot and Forgefoot, meanwhile, had discovered new callings—security, logistics, construction, and systems design—and saw no need to return to their former ways. This divergence has led to ongoing tension and occasional conflict between clans, though the impact of their work has, in many circles, outweighed the significance of their internal disagreements.

## Lightfoots

After the fall and rebuilding of civilization, the Lightfoot clan scattered across the world, bringing their traditions with them. Though their communities are often small, their influence is widespread, especially in fields tied to biology, chemistry, and restorative science. Most Lightfoots follow paths that keep them behind the front lines—working as alchemists, researchers, medics, environmental engineers, or data archivists. Their knowledge of natural systems and chemical synthesis is unmatched in many circles, though their cautious nature and tendency to flee rather than fight has earned them a reputation for being risk-averse, if not outright evasive.

Despite their contributions, the Lightfoots have not let go of the old grudges. They remain critical of the other halfling clans, seeing their divergence from traditional practices as short-sighted or selfish. Though they will collaborate when necessity demands it, they rarely do so without commentary—quick to point out tactical flaws, lapses in protocol, or any problems that can be traced back to their kin. This friction hasn’t stopped their work, but it often makes them a challenging, if undeniably valuable, presence in any joint operation.

## Stout

Following the reformation of society, the Stoutfoot clan chose to cast off their old name, rebranding themselves as the Stoutguard clan to reflect their departure from the rigid traditions of their Lightfoot cousins. Known across numerous settlements, enclaves, and frontier stations, Stoutguards are rarely wanderers or hunters. Instead, they dedicate themselves to the protection of the communities where they were born—serving as wardens, peacekeepers, and defenders against the dangers that still lurk in the wild zones and decaying infrastructures. While it is uncommon, some Stoutguards have risen beyond local service to join the ranks of planetary peacekeeping orders or elite defense guilds. Those who achieve such recognition become living legends among their people, symbols of halfling resilience and the belief that strength and duty can forge just as much legacy as knowledge or invention.

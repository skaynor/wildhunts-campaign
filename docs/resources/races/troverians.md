# Troverians

Known in pre-collapse times as “Forgefoots,” the people now called Troverians adopted their current name in the era of rediscovery. Unlike dwarves—who are often steeped in mythic origins—Troverians are believed to have descended from early human settlers who adapted to deep, rugged environments. Generations spent beneath the surface or among isolated mountain colonies changed them physically and mentally. They developed resilient bodies, sharp instincts, and a deep connection to the mechanical and mineral worlds around them.

Troverians were vital to the height of the ancient civilization’s technological growth. Skilled in practical innovation and hybridized engineering, they often worked alongside other crafting races to merge old-world metallurgy with cutting-edge systems. Their influence led to the creation of highly autonomous constructs and machinery that outlasted even their creators. While many Troverians still celebrate this ingenuity, some carry unease over the long-reaching consequences of that era’s unchecked advancement.

Today, Troverians maintain strongholds in remote highlands, underground habitats, and reclaimed industrial ruins. In recent years, some have formed joint communities with other artisan-focused peoples, where they collaborate on the development of advanced tools, portable energy sources, and modular weaponry for explorers and recovery crews. These enclaves operate with quiet efficiency, relying on age-old methods adapted for modern realities.

Adventuring Troverians almost always carry a trade with them—be it smithing, machining, electronics, or salvagecraft. Many join expeditions to locate lost technology or extract rare materials, driven by both personal craft and a sense of obligation to their communities. Though they may appear gruff or methodical, Troverians take great pride in what they build, and in their eyes, a life well-forged is the greatest legacy one can leave behind.

## Troverian Traits

Troverians resemble short, slightly stockier, and bulkier humans and are commonly mistaken for dwarves. Their skin usually tanned, Troverians males grow massive beards and moustaches, wearing them in odd but traditional shapes. Female Troverians lack facial hair all together, resembling human females with a smaller but sturdier frame.

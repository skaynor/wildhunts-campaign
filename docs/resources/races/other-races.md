# Other Races

There are many other races that live within the Monster Hunter Universe. Many of these races fought alongside or against the humans, elves, and all the other races listed above in one of the two wars. Their origins all begin with being created by one god or another, and which one that created them might vary in your world. Their history and relevance to the ancient civilization are for you to choose, but typically their culture and personalities remain the same as they would in any standard dungeons and dragons campaign setting.

## Monstrous Races

The monstrous races of the Old World were born in many different ways. Many of them were born when Fatalis and the other corrupted gods attempted to influence the races of the world. The kobolds were once dragonborns that were twisted into the scrawny-like creatures of today. The Orcs were once goliaths and humans; the goblins, halflings; and tritons were molded into sahuagin.

Not all of the monstrous races were created in this way though, many of them were created from the corruption themselves. Bugbears, hobgoblins, and yuan-ti were all created in such a way. Other than their creation most of these races all act as the GM sees fit. The character's aren't defined by their origins, but by their actions and how they were raised.

There will be very few of these in the campaign, and probably none will be encounters.

Now that we have covered all the races, let's determine your background by identifying the faction you are apart of.

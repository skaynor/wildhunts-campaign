# Other Races

Countless other sentient species exist across the known world, many with roots stretching back to the age of the ancient civilization. Some fought beside humanity and the other core races in forgotten conflicts, while others opposed them or simply endured in isolation. Their origins are often obscured by time—lost to fractured records, genetic drift, or ideological myth—but their cultures and core identities remain intact. How they rose, adapted, or influenced the world is left to interpretation, but their personalities, societal roles, and interactions often mirror those found in more traditional accounts. Whether integrated into major settlements or surviving in the margins, these races are yours to shape—and their pasts, like much of the world, are waiting to be rediscovered.

## Monstrous Races

The monstrous races of the Old World came into being through a wide range of unnatural transformations. Some were the result of failed experiments, viral alterations, or exposure to entities that sought to manipulate existing species for their own ends. Kobolds, for instance, are believed to have descended from dragonborn, warped by prolonged exposure to unstable materials or ideological subjugation. Orcs share genetic markers with both goliaths and humans, while goblins bear a disturbing resemblance to halflings twisted by long-term corruption. Even sahuagin are thought to have originated from deep-water tritons, altered beyond recognition by biological or psychic tampering.

Not all monstrous races share such direct ancestry. Bugbears, hobgoblins, yuan-ti, and others seem to have emerged from raw corruption itself—life forms born not through descent but through contamination, aberrant evolution, or intentional creation. Whatever their origin, most monstrous species behave and develop based on their environment and upbringing. In this world, a being’s history may inform its shape—but never its fate. Identity is forged through choices, not just creation.

Now that we have covered all the races, let's figure out which weapon you will be using.

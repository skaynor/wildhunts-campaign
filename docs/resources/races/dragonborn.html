<p>The draconic traits of the Dragonborn are not gifts from deities, but echoes of entropy-formed apex predators—monsters designed by the Seeds to consume and collapse ecosystems. Dragonborn blood carries the genetic memory of these creatures: elemental breath, resilient flesh, and instinctual dominance. Though stable, they are still mutative. Some Dragonborn develop changes across generations; others awaken one day with a new scale pattern, a second heartbeat, or fragmented visions of burning planets.</p>
<p>Because of this, Dragonborn are often viewed with suspicion—or awe. Entire arcologies have banned them. Others elevate them as Saints of Survival or guardians against further Seed incursion. But to most, they are dangerous reminders that the Seeds can change people.</p>
<p>There is no united Dragonborn culture. They are drifters, remnants, patched-in citizens of megacities and orbital habitats. Some live in self-imposed isolation, fearing their own biology. Others become mercenaries or corporate assets, trading their strength for protection or purpose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elder-dragonborn">Elder Dragonborn<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elder Dragonborn" title="Direct link to Elder Dragonborn" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/races/dragonborn#elder-dragonborn">​</a></h2>
<p>The Elder Dragonborn are a dragonborn variant. You can allow a player to choose one of the following dragonborn ancestries. These ancestries replace the normal draconic ancestry a dragonborn can choose in addition to replacing other traits as listed. These ancestries also provide the damage they are resistant to, if the draconic resistance trait is not replaced.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="draconic-ancestry-alatreon">Draconic Ancestry: Alatreon<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Draconic Ancestry: Alatreon" title="Direct link to Draconic Ancestry: Alatreon" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/races/dragonborn#draconic-ancestry-alatreon">​</a></h3>
<p>The alatreon dragonborn personality is matched only by its ability to harness the elements. They more often prefer to live in solitude, but are known to work with others or insert themselves into a situation when it benefits them. Their bodies are covered in reverse scales that they use to control the cold, fire, lightning, or necrotic elements. Atop of the alatreon dragonborn head are two large horns that act as a conduit for their elemental powers.</p>
<p>An alatreon dragonborn uses the dragonborn traits in the Player’s Handbook, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Breath Weapon.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, and one other ability scores of your choice between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma increases by 1.</li>
<li><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&#x27;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Draconic Resistance. You have resistance to one of the following damage types: cold, fire, necrotic.</li>
<li><em><strong>Elemental Affinity.</strong></em> When you deal cold, fire, lightning, or necrotic damage, you can add your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier to the damage. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
<li><em><strong>Menacing.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="draconic-ancestry-amatsu">Draconic Ancestry: Amatsu<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Draconic Ancestry: Amatsu" title="Direct link to Draconic Ancestry: Amatsu" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/races/dragonborn#draconic-ancestry-amatsu">​</a></h3>
<p>Amatsumagatsuchi dragonborn&#x27;s head is adorned with large golden horns. Their scales are largely pale white and fins that stretch across all four limbs and back. Many of them are known to wear long flowing clothing, as a representation of amatsumagatsuchi&#x27;s webbing, while others use it as a means to hide the fact that their feet never touch the ground.</p>
<p>An Amatsumagatsuchi dragonborn uses the dragonborn traits in the Player&#x27;s Handbook, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Breath Weapon traits.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. Draconic Resistance. You have resistance to radiant
damage.</li>
<li><em><strong>Elder Dragon Magic.</strong></em> You know the gust cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the thunderwave spell once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the levitate spell once, and it recharges after a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these
spells.</li>
<li><em><strong>Glide.</strong></em> You always hover one to two inches off the ground. Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no
extra movement.</li>
<li><em><strong>Wind Barrier.</strong></em> You can use an action to summon a barrier of wind around you for 1 minute. While the barrier is active, you have half cover against range attacks, resistance to nonmagical ammunition, and disperse any fog like effect in a 5-foot radius around you. Once used, you can&#x27;t use this trait
again until you finish a long rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="draconic-ancestry-ceadeus">Draconic Ancestry: Ceadeus<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Draconic Ancestry: Ceadeus" title="Direct link to Draconic Ancestry: Ceadeus" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/races/dragonborn#draconic-ancestry-ceadeus">​</a></h3>
<p>Due to the ceadeus resemblance to giant whales, the ceadeus dragonborn&#x27;s shape is portly. Both male and female prominent beards of fur and two massive horn that must be shaved down or overtake their eyes, leaving them blind. Luminous organs line the ceadeus dragonborn&#x27;s belly as well as its appendages, which turn from blue to red when it is angered.</p>
<p>A ceadeus dragonborn uses the dragonborn traits in the Player&#x27;s Handbook, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase, Speed, and Breath Weapon traits.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom increases by 1.</li>
<li><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</li>
<li><em><strong>Bioluminescence.</strong></em> As an action, you can emit dim light from your body in a 5-foot radius. While emitting the light, you can use a bonus action to increase the illumination to bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius), or extinguishes the light.</li>
<li><em><strong>Shared Breath.</strong></em> You can hold your breath for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier. In addition, you are able to share oxygen with creatures that are within 5 feet of you by splitting the time you can hold your breath by the number of creatures in the area around you.</li>
<li><em><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to acid damage.</li>
<li><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&#x27;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
<li><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</li>

<p>Chameleos dragonborn scales are purple, though their limbs and stomach are bare, showing off-white skin. They have long, elastic tongues, but unlike the Chameleos, the dragonborn&#x27;s eyes do not resemble a chameleon&#x27;s in shape. Instead, their iris and pupil simulate the look.</p>
<p>A chameleos dragonborn uses the dragonborn traits in the Player&#x27;s Handbook, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Breath Weapon.</p>
<ul>

# Gnomes

Gnomes and their vibrant culture were once a cornerstone of daily life during the height of the ancient civilizations. Their presence could be felt everywhere—no settlement was without the hum of spinning mechanisms, the sudden crack of a misfired prototype, or the sound of excited chatter followed by raucous laughter. Gnomes were widely celebrated for their endless creativity, contributing countless innovations in engineering, energy systems, and microtech design. Though their numbers dwindled after society’s collapse, remnants of their brilliance endure. Towering archives buried deep in the eastern zones and a partially intact orbital corridor station off the coast remain as gleaming—if half-functioning—reminders of a time when the gnomes helped shape the future with every spark, screw, and miscalculated blast.

## Rock Gnomes

Rock gnomes remain the most grounded in the legacy of their ancestors, especially when compared to their forest-dwelling kin. Their innate curiosity toward machinery and systems drives them to constantly explore, modify, and repurpose whatever technology they can find. This inventiveness is rarely self-serving—rock gnomes are deeply motivated by a desire to improve the daily lives of those around them. Whether working as chemists, salvage engineers, or local fixers, they are always searching for new ways to turn broken parts and forgotten resources into something meaningful, functional, and often unexpectedly brilliant.

## Forest Gnomes

Forest gnomes are the descendants of a research colony of rock gnomes who, during the height of the ancient civilization, accidentally displaced themselves while experimenting with advanced spatial transport technology. Cut off from communication and return, the group adapted over generations to a wild and untamed biome where nature dominated and technology had to bend to survive. By the time their descendants found their way back to the known world, they had become something new—smaller, more in tune with their environment, and deeply intuitive when it came to natural systems.

Now settled across the fertile regions of the Verdant Hills, forest gnomes prefer life in close harmony with natural ecosystems rather than the structured noise of urban settlements. Despite their differences in lifestyle, they maintain a strong bond with their rock gnome cousins, often collaborating to bridge the gap between organic systems and mechanical ones. Forest gnomes are also known for forming close bonds with other woodland folk and creatures, offering assistance and companionship with ease. Their connection with small fauna makes them exceptional scouts and field operatives, often employed by exploration guilds and research crews to gather intel from areas where drones or humans would draw too much attention.

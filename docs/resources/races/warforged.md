# Warforged

During the height of the ancient civilization, a new form of life was created—not by divine will, but by human design. These constructs, called Equal Hunter Weapons or “EHWs,” were developed to meet the escalating demands of an increasingly fragile world. The earliest models were non-sapient machines built to operate in hazardous environments, tasked with resource extraction, containment of rogue fauna, and heavy labor well beyond the limits of organic life.

As their creators refined the EHW systems, breakthroughs in synthetic biology and energy regulation led to the emergence of sentient models—constructs capable of learning, adapting, and acting independently. Through the integration of experimental energy cores and bio-reactive materials, these constructs evolved into what are now known as warforged. Designed to be self-sustaining and responsive, they became specialists, guardians, and explorers in their own right.

In the present day, warforged are rarely encountered. Most remain dormant in long-abandoned facilities, decommissioned ships, or forgotten outposts. Occasionally, one awakens, often without clear purpose or intact memory. These individuals are no longer bound by original programming and are considered free-willed beings. Each awakening brings with it uncertainty—about identity, about origin, and about what a synthetic lifeform owes to a world that no longer remembers why it was made.

Though viewed with suspicion by some, warforged have slowly earned recognition as a people rather than machines. They are survivors of a lost era, walking remnants of a time when the boundary between life and design was deliberately blurred. Now free from the directives of their makers, warforged forge their own paths—seeking meaning in a galaxy that left them behind.

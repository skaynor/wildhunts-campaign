# Tieflings

Unworthy. Power-hungry. Abominations. These are just a few of the names cast at the earliest tieflings—humans whose pursuit of forbidden transformation set them apart from the rest of civilization. Long ago, a fringe group of bio-alchemists, obsessed with unlocking a higher form of life, began experimenting with the fusion of human physiology and unstable lifeforms. Their efforts were dismissed, banned, or ignored by most major institutions. But isolation did not stop them. Over time, their leader found success by pushing beyond ethical and biological boundaries, using volatile genetic material drawn from an apex predator of the era. The cost was irreversible.

The first tieflings bore the imprint of their transformation openly. Their bodies showed dramatic physical mutations: thick, curved horns, sharp fangs, glowing eyes, and tails covered in fur or sinew. Their coloration reflected the intensity of the process—ranging from fiery reds and oranges to deep golds. The males often had flowing hair that sparked or shimmered unnaturally, while females bore luminous skin patterns and iridescent hair between their horns. These appearances were both admired and feared.

Though they had achieved what some considered a form of ascension, their methods horrified the rest of the world. Tieflings became outcasts, accused of disrupting the natural order. Shunned from major settlements, they formed isolated communes and hidden research enclaves. Despite their exile, others—disillusioned scholars, desperate wanderers, and those abandoned by society—sought them out. The tieflings continued their work, refining their techniques and creating new variants with distinct traits and appearances, each shaped by different combinations of unknown genetic material. These experiments only deepened the rift between them and the wider world.

Eventually, these lineages faded from public memory. When tieflings began to reappear in more recent centuries, they had changed. No longer bearing the primal traits of their original ancestors, their appearances had shifted toward the more alien and uncanny—skin in shades not seen in nature, horns of unpredictable shapes, and eyes that shimmered like static. Though their bloodlines were diluted and scattered, their presence was still met with suspicion. Some remembered the myths. Others just sensed something... off.

Despite the unease they inspire, tieflings are far more complex than their origins suggest. Their charisma, cleverness, and deep emotional loyalty make them natural leaders and tacticians. They may be slow to trust, but once bonds are formed, they are unwavering in their support. For those who look past appearance and origin, tieflings are often the first to step forward when others hesitate—and the last to turn their back when the stakes are high.

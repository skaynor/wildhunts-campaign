# Dwarves

The bold and enduring dwarves of the old world are renowned for their skill in metallurgy, engineering, and heavy labor—traits honed through centuries of life carved into stone and steel. While many trace their roots back to a singular industrial stronghold buried in the western ranges, dwarven culture has spread widely across the fractured settlements of the world. Their ancestral foundries and subterranean halls remain symbols of their enduring craftsmanship, though in recent generations, they have shared these spaces with allied kin—most notably the troverians. Through this collaboration, dwarves have advanced numerous breakthroughs in survival gear, modular tools, and structural reinforcement that remain essential to frontier life.

Though traditionally tied to the mountains, both mountain and hill dwarves now live across many trade hubs and border towns, often in smaller numbers than in ages past. Hill dwarves in particular are known for establishing fortified above-ground settlements, functioning as waystations, repair outposts, or small-scale manufacturing sites. Some dwarves, drawn to the mysteries of the past and the thrill of reclaiming lost technologies, pursue work as salvagers, heavy-gear mercenaries, or expedition specialists. Whether hammering away in quiet workshops or holding the line on the edge of the wilds, dwarves remain a cornerstone of reconstruction and reliability in a world still struggling to find its footing.

## Duergar

Duergar are dwarves whose ancestors turned away from traditional values, allowing bitterness, ambition, and self-interest to shape their future. Over generations, these dwarves isolated themselves in deep geological fault zones and volcanic substructures, far removed from surface communities. Cut off from the rest of dwarven society and shaped by extreme environments and internal power struggles, they evolved into something far more hardened and ruthless. Their relationship to other dwarven kin mirrors the divide between surface and shadow—familiar, yet fractured beyond repair.

Modern duergar are known for their cruelty and cynicism. Their culture values control, pain, and psychological dominance, often seeing empathy as weakness. As a people, they are deeply distrustful, believing betrayal and manipulation to be inevitable in all interactions. Few duergar leave their strongholds willingly. Those who do are often exiles—criminals, gladiators, or hardened survivors cast out by their own kind. In the wider world, these individuals typically care only for personal gain, survival, or vengeance, and are rarely interested in redemption. They are survivors of a society built on bitterness, and they carry its weight in every step.

## Hill Dwarves

Hill dwarves share the same durability and resilience as their mountain kin, but they tend to be more approachable and socially adaptable. Known for their deep appreciation of material goods, hill dwarves believe that the physical resources of the world exist to be shaped—refined into tools, art, and architecture that outlast their creators. For a hill dwarf, purpose is found in the act of making—of turning raw matter into something meaningful through skill and intention.

Their ancestors were once part of mountain dwarf communities, displaced by collapse, conflict, or structural failure. Rather than retreating deeper underground, they chose to rise—literally and culturally—establishing new lives on the surface. Over generations, these dwarves integrated with broader communities, finding new forms of commerce, spiritual growth, and even magical practices once frowned upon by their more conservative kin. Though they still respect their origins, hill dwarves see themselves as builders of the future rather than preservers of the past.

## Mountain Dwarves

Whether or not mountain dwarves were shaped by the bedrock itself is irrelevant—they’ve come to embody much of what defines the stone they dwell among: strength, endurance, and unyielding resolve. These dwarves maintain deep ties to tradition, viewing the remnants of ancient civilizations not just as ruins, but as blueprints for enduring survival. Their culture places immense respect on lineage, labor, and legacy. Known for their stoicism and pragmatism, mountain dwarves are often seen as gruff by outsiders, but their blunt manner hides a deep well of collective wisdom and discipline earned through centuries of hardship.

Earning a mountain dwarf’s trust is no small feat, but once granted, that bond is nearly unbreakable. Loyalty, in their eyes, is not simply an ideal—it’s a contract, and one they hold sacred. This mindset has made them naturally guarded, particularly toward outsiders, due to long histories of betrayal during failed territorial expansions and broken alliances. These events have left entire clans wary of other cultures, and some have taken it upon themselves to patrol old fault lines and abandoned facilities, enforcing strict isolation. For mountain dwarves, trust is precious, tradition is survival, and mistakes—especially repeated ones—are carved into memory like names into stone.

# Tritons

Tritons are believed to be among the first humans to undergo a lasting transformation in response to the ocean’s call—altered not by machines, but by something deeper and older. Their physiology became attuned to the crushing depths and pressure zones of the sea, and over generations, they developed a natural command of aquatic environments. This legacy of transformation and duty has given many tritons an air of pride that is often mistaken for arrogance. In truth, most believe deeply in their responsibility to safeguard others, even if their sense of superiority can sometimes make that protection feel condescending.

Ancient records and oral traditions speak of a time when tritons suffered great losses—though the exact cause has been lost or suppressed. During this age of upheaval, a significant number of tritons were altered or corrupted, changing into aggressive aquatic species that remain hostile to this day. Some believe these twisted offshoots still lurk in the deepest rifts of the sea, waiting. Despite this painful legacy, the tritons endured, and over time they reclaimed their places in the ocean’s balance.

In the generations since, tritons have continued to serve as keepers of the deep. Many build their homes beside unstable oceanic trenches, underwater geothermal zones, or bio-reactive ecosystems that most land-dwellers consider uninhabitable. These settlements are sparse, self-sufficient, and often intentionally isolated—tasked with watching and, if necessary, containing what others would rather forget.

Not all tritons live in the depths, however. Many now reside in coastal stations, aquatic ports, or drifting ocean colonies. These tritons often work as submersible pilots, salvage divers, data couriers, or mechanics specializing in pressurized systems. Others become explorers or join research guilds, leveraging their biological adaptations and underwater knowledge to chart the unknown. Though they rarely abandon their sense of duty, tritons who walk among the surface races often learn humility—and in turn, teach others the hidden power of the sea

# Wyverians

The Wyverians are not human—though they might appear it in silhouette. Beneath their slender frames and sharp features lies an ancient, elegant biology rooted not in man, but in Wyverns—one of the first stable forms of life shaped by the laws of post-time.

Unlike the entropy-born monsters created by the Seeds, Wyverians were born of intention. They are the enduring counter-rhythm to the Seeds’ discord. Where the Seeds fracture and mutate, the Wyverians preserve, harmonize, and remember. Their very existence is an act of cosmic resistance.

According to recovered fragments of pre-collapse records and the oral codes of the Wyverians themselves, they were shaped by the Fifth Aspect: Eldath, a being of unknowable patience and deep design. From the primordial wyverns that survived the universe’s first convulsions, Eldath refined a species capable not of destruction, but of interpretation, guidance, and connection.

## A Wyverian's Thinking

Wyverians think differently than most races, perhaps in part due to their increased lifespan, and are often considered more intelligent and rational. Some Wyverians have an extensive education, more than most races can learn in a feasible timespan, and are versed in multiple subjects. They are also more attuned to nature, which they greatly respect. They are peaceful and prefer to avoid conflict if possible. Wyverian humor is strange by human standards.

# Lynians

Lynians are a relatively common species known for their adaptability and resilience, often compared to that of humans. Though many subspecies originated from a single continental cradle, they have since spread across a wide range of environments—arid surface colonies, deep substructure warrens, orbital stations, and reclaimed settlements alike. Their physical form, marked by short stature and beast-like features, allows them to navigate areas and perform tasks that larger-bodied species struggle with.

Within multispecies communities, Lynians often face social hurdles rooted in outdated biases or aesthetic discomfort. Among the “tall folk,” their size and appearance are sometimes mistaken for simplicity, but those assumptions quickly fall away in the face of the Lynians’ wit, grit, and competency. Many earn their place through hard work, sharp humor, or sheer tenacity, taking on roles as technicians, traders, agriculturalists, and explorers. In particular, some Lynians are known for partnering with frontier crews or recovery teams, offering their skills in navigation, small-scale maintenance, or precision combat. Others live independently, traveling the system as contract specialists, scavengers, or freelance troubleshooters—valued not in spite of their form, but because of what it enables.

## Lynian Traits

Your lynian character has a variety of natural abilities, honed during their younger years.

- ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Lynian, and one other language of their choice.
- ***Subrace.*** Six main subraces of Lynian exist: Boaboa, Felynes, Melynx, Gajalaka, Grimalkyne, and Shakalakas.  
Choose one of these subraces.

## Boaboa

The Boaboa are a hardy subspecies of Lynians known for their ability to survive and thrive in extreme cold. Adapted to sub-zero climates and perpetual twilight, they make their homes in the deep arctic zones of the world—windswept plateaus, frozen wreck sites, and geothermal cave systems. Unique among their kin, the Boaboa hold deep reverence for the great herd beasts that share their lands, viewing these creatures as spiritual protectors and symbols of endurance. This reverence shapes much of their culture, from ritual hunts to longform oral traditions passed between generations.

Centuries ago, the Boaboa aligned themselves with a powerful outside force that promised protection for their herds and vengeance against those who hunted them. Under this pact, the Boaboa carried out brutal ambushes against intruders who came seeking fur, meat, or territory. They earned a fearsome reputation, but in time, the cost of this alliance revealed itself. The conflict left lasting damage—contaminated water sources, mass die-offs, and poisoned ice fields. In the end, neither the land nor the creatures they had vowed to protect were spared.

Since that era, the Boaboa have become more reclusive. Their trust must be earned, not asked for. Still, they continue to guard the cold regions they call home, now with a focus on stewardship and mutual survival. Though relations with other arctic-dwelling peoples remain tense—particularly with the goliaths, whose history is stained by mutual blood—the Boaboa have begun to reconnect with the broader world in small ways. When trust is earned, a Boaboa companion becomes a steadfast ally—fierce in battle, patient in hardship, and loyal beyond question.

### Boaboa Traits

The Boaboa have the basic shape of a Grimalkyne, but exhibit much thicker, white fur and a bulkier frame. They wear crude imitations of Popo heads as masks, with the tusk's tips painted in colors that correspond to the status ailment each individual Boaboa uses in combat.

- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
- ***Alignment.*** Boaboa tends toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A sense of community can drive boaboas toward lawful alignments.
- ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
- ***Frost Resistance.*** You have resistance to cold damage.
- ***Ice Walk.*** You can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.
- ***Tribal Mask.*** You have a mask that is a crude imitation of a popo's head that has its tusks painted a color. Choose one color from the Popo Mask table. Your boa javelin and your gajalaka tolerance is determined by the color of the mask's accents, as shown in the table.  
Should this mask be destroyed, you can recreate a new one during a short or long rest, but the accent color cannot change.

  **Popo Mask Table**

  | Tusk Color  | Condition | Duration |
| :------------ | :-------- | :------- |
| Blue          | Blinded   | 1 minute (saving throw repeated at end of turn) |
| Yellow        | Stunned   | Until the end of your next turn |
| Purple        | Poisoned  | 1 minute |

- ***Boa Javelin.*** Your javelin’s blade is coated with a viscous liquid that is an opaque color, similar to the color of your mask’s tusks. When you hit a creature with it, they take damage as normal, but they must also make a Constitution saving throw.  
The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature is afflicted with the condition based on your mask's tusk color and lasts for the duration listed in the Popo Mask table.  
After you hit a creature with this javelin, the javelin breaks. During a short or long rest, you can create a new javelin, but you can never carry more than one boa javelin at a time.
- ***Boaboa Tolerance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against the condition associated with your tribal mask.

## Felyne & Melynx

Among the most common and well-integrated Lynian subspecies are the Felyne and Melynx. Their small stature and quick minds allow them to adapt easily to life among other peoples, often working in communal roles such as cooks, assistants, field engineers, or technicians. While both subspecies share a general friendliness and industriousness, the Melynx in particular have a more mischievous streak. It’s not uncommon for small valuables or tools to “mysteriously” end up in their possession. They usually return these items when asked—though anything unclaimed tends to be safely stored in their living quarters until someone eventually comes looking for it. Those among them who seek greater respect or a more adventurous life often join exploration teams, scavenger crews, or recovery specialists, where their agility and sharp instincts serve them well.

In more remote regions, both Felyne and Melynx are known to form tight-knit, intelligent communities—self-sustaining villages often built in inaccessible terrain or forgotten ruins. These settlements operate with a high level of organization and are rarely disturbed by hostile creatures or outside threats. They regularly trade with other Lynian subspecies and even interact with distant cultures, offering specialized goods, knowledge, or healing services. These wild-dwelling groups tend to live in close harmony with the natural world and the strange energies that linger in the forgotten places. Many of their spiritual leaders, scouts, and herbalists follow deeply rooted traditions, and it’s not uncommon for their most respected members to act as wandering guides, frontier medics, or ecological stewards.

### Felyne Traits

Felynes are recognized by their white fur and have the ability to talk in human language, and can be found both in human villages and in the wild.

- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.
- ***Alignment.*** Felynes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are found in villages working as adventurers, chefs, farmers, or traders. Those who tend toward chaos are from the wilderness and live off the land as scavengers and hunters. Felyne are good-hearted and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
- ***Alignment.*** Melynx tend toward chaotic alignments as they let impulse, curiosity, and mischievousness guide their decisions. Melynx that grow up in villages tend towards good, but those mistreated or those who grew up in the wilderness lean towards neutral or evil.

- ***Meowster Chef.*** You have proficiency with cook’s utensils.

## Gajalaka

The Gajalaka are an aggressive and reclusive Lynian subspecies known for their hostility toward both large creatures and outsiders who enter their territory uninvited. Unlike their Shakalaka cousins, who are more inclined to curiosity or trade, the Gajalaka have long embraced isolation and conflict as tools of survival. Highly territorial and tactically cunning, they are notorious for setting traps, striking from ambush, and vanishing into their environment before retaliation can come. Their reputation as dangerous outlanders has followed them for generations.

Following a series of conflicts that severely reduced their numbers, the surviving Gajalaka retreated deep into uncharted or inaccessible zones—abandoned subterranean complexes, buried industrial zones, or warped wildernesses. There they remained hidden, rebuilding their strength and community far from the eyes of the outside world. Only recently have small groups begun to reappear, but interactions remain tense. Most Gajalaka refuse cooperation with other races unless exiled, outcast, or offered a mutually beneficial deal they cannot ignore.

Among those who have emerged, many Gajalaka are known for their association with practices viewed as taboo in civilized society—rogue technicians, cybernetic scavengers, black market medics, or those rumored to delve into forbidden sciences. Whether through fear, prejudice, or lived experience, most communities treat Gajalaka with suspicion. Still, those few who earn their trust—or survive long enough to understand their motives—find them to be fiercely loyal, tactically brilliant, and deeply protective of those they accept as kin.

### Gajalaka Traits

Gajalaka are short humanoids. They resemble Shakalaka more than Felynes or Grimalkynes, lacking any fur and wearing large tribal masks which leave only their bright yellow eyes visible. These red masks have different color accents, ranging from blue to yellow to purple, to represent what status ailment their weapons afflict. The Gajalaka in the Caverns of El Dorado have golden masks.

- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
- ***Alignment.*** Gajalaka are proud and barbaric, and are not strongly inclined toward good. They are slow to trust, but once someone gains the trust of a gajalaka, they are considered an ally for life, or until proven otherwise.
- ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
- ***Herbalist.*** You have proficiency in the Nature skill.
- ***Tool Proficiency.*** You have proficiency with poisoner's kit.
- ***Tribal Mask.*** You have a red tribal mask that is accented by a color. Choose one color from the Tribal Mask table. Your gaja knife and your gajalaka tolerance is determined by the color of the mask's accents, as shown in the table.  
Should this mask be destroyed, you can recreate a new one during a short or long rest, but the accent color cannot change.

  **Tribal Mask Table**

  | Accent Color  | Condition | Duration |
| :------------ | :-------- | :------- |
| Blue          | Blinded   | 1 minute (saving throw repeated at end of turn) |
| Yellow        | Stunned   | Until the end of your next turn |
| Purple        | Poisoned  | 1 minute |

- ***Gaja Knife.*** Your knife is coated with viscous liquid that is an opaque color, similar to the color of your mask's accents. You're proficient with this knife, and it has the finesse and thrown property, with a normal range of 20 and a long range of 40. When you hit with a weapon attack using it, the target takes 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier as piercing damage and they must make a Constitution saving throw.  
The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature is afflicted with the condition based on your mask's accent color and lasts for the duration listed in the Tribal Mask table.  
After you hit a creature with this knife, it shatters. During a short or long rest, you can create a new gaja knife, but you can never carry more than one at a time.
- ***Gajalaka Tolerance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against the condition associated with your tribal mask.

## Grimalkyne

The Grimalkyne were once a unified Lynian culture—an outlander people who lived off the land, maintained their independence from centralized civilizations, and maintained a spiritual connection to the natural cycles of the world. Even in the age of towering cities and mechanized systems, the Grimalkyne remained grounded in tradition, forming tight-knit communities that relied on ancestral memory, herbal knowledge, and instinct over digital records and synthetic solutions.

Their unity fractured during an age of upheaval, when their leaders could no longer agree on how best to preserve the tribe’s future. Four distinct philosophies emerged, each forming the foundation of a new tribe. One group, later called the Bugtrappers, withdrew deep into ancient forests and overgrown arcologies, choosing isolation, reflection, and long-term preservation. The Protectors and Troupers took a more direct approach, aligning with outside communities and offering their skills in medicine, tracking, and defense. Many of the Grimalkyne who work as assistants, scouts, or field operatives among other peoples hail from these two tribes. The final group, the Plunderers, rejected cooperation or seclusion, choosing instead to survive through scavenging, resource control, and opportunism, even if it meant crossing moral lines.

In the current age, the Bugtrappers remain elusive forest-dwellers, known for their knowledge of forgotten systems and ability to navigate hostile terrain with ease. They offer guidance, healing, or shelter to those who earn their respect. The Protectors and Troupers have built structured highland and desert communities, occasionally sending envoys to towns, trade networks, or research hubs in peaceful exchange. Meanwhile, the Plunderers continue to operate in the shadows—hoarding tech, salvaging from restricted zones, or impersonating other tribes to bypass scrutiny. While their methods are questionable, their motivations often stem from desperation, pride, or a belief that survival justifies the means.

### Grimalkyne Traits

Grimalkyne resemble bipedal lynxes. They have tufted ears, and come in a variety of colors depending on the tribe.

- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
- ***Alignment.*** Most grimalkynes are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.
- ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- ***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
- ***Tracker.*** You have proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills.
- ***Grimalkyne Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the glaive, javelin, net, and trident.

## Shakalaka

The Shakalaka are a fiercely independent subspecies of Lynians, culturally distinct and largely disconnected from the more structured societies of the world. Though capable hunters and resource gatherers, their isolationist nature and resistance to technological integration have left them labeled as primitive by outsiders. Long before the collapse of the old world, the Shakalaka chose to seclude themselves deep in overgrown biowild zones and ancient forest complexes. This isolation shielded them from many catastrophic events, but also hindered their development, causing them to retain a tribal, often violent culture in the face of growing interspecies networks.

Among the Shakalaka, younger members are often sent on solitary rites of passage to prove themselves to their elders. These initiates—known in their language as “unripe”—must venture beyond the boundaries of their territory and return with something of value to the tribe. This item may be a rare component, a valuable piece of tech, or an artifact with historical or spiritual importance. While many of these initiates view outsiders as threats, there are rare cases where they choose to travel alongside offworlders or scavengers, seeking knowledge and strength before completing their journey.

Young Shakalaka are easily identified by the distinct masks they wear—crafted from natural or salvaged materials. Unlike adult Shakalaka, whose hardened gourd-like helms are symbols of earned status, initiates wear smaller, more expressive masks, often styled from acorns, bones, or lightweight metals. Those few who eventually bond with outlanders or join exploration crews are known to upgrade these masks into reinforced helms, often constructed from the remains of powerful creatures or machines they have defeated, transforming their personal growth into a symbol of identity and status within their tribe.

### Shakalaka Traits

Shakalaka are small, humanoid creatures with green skin. They wear a mask over their heads at all times, so their true faces are unknown.

- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 1.
- ***Alignment.*** Shakalaka are typically neutral evil, as they care only for their own needs. A few shakalaka might tend toward good or neutrality, but only rarely.
- ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
- ***Aggressive.*** You pursue foes relentlessly, even at great risk to yourself. As a bonus action, you may move up to your speed towards a hostile creature you can see.
- ***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
- ***Natural Athlete.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.
- ***Shakalaka Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the club, greatclub, morningstar, and warhammer.

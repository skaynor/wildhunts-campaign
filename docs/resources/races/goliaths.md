# Goliaths

One of the last known sentient species to emerge before the collapse of the old world, the goliaths are a people shaped by the snowbound extremes of the high mountain ranges. Their culture was born from reverence—not toward gods, but toward the colossal, ancient lifeforms that once roamed the glacial valleys. Goliaths are deeply traditional, valuing personal challenge, communal strength, and fairness above all else. They keep meticulous records of accomplishments, not to boast, but to track growth, resolve disputes, and honor the memory of those who came before. To outsiders unfamiliar with this custom, their constant score-keeping can seem irritating, but to a goliath, it is simply a way of life.

To goliaths, measuring one’s actions is not about dominance—it’s a practice of self-awareness and accountability. It is common for two goliaths to compare experiences over a fire, not to compete, but to reflect on effort and resilience. This ritual of recounting deeds and trials is integral to their social structure and identity, forming the basis for leadership, mentorship, and even marriage customs within their tribes.

Historically, goliaths lived in small, self-sustaining nomadic groups high in the frozen elevations. Tribes typically consisted of three to five extended families, rarely numbering more than sixty. Most members remained in the tribe for life unless split or mergers became necessary due to environmental strain or dwindling resources. They avoided large-scale conflicts unless pushed to the edge and favored solving disputes through contest or consensus rather than war.

In the old world’s final era, many goliaths suffered catastrophic losses tied to the extinction of the great megafauna they had revered and protected. These events shattered their cohesion and led them to seek new ways to preserve their traditions. Some turned outward, forging uneasy alliances with other peoples. Though the blood price was high, the experience broadened their view of the world, and the bonds they formed with others helped shape their next chapter.

When society began to rebuild, the goliaths became critical to the survival of early mountain settlements. Their knowledge of the highland terrain and their harsh lifestyle enabled them to guide others safely through the dangers of the icebound frontier. While many tribes remain nomadic, others have integrated into fixed settlements as security forces, heavy laborers, or wilderness guides. The founding of the hunters’ guilds and competitive trade networks appealed to their cultural ideals—offering a new arena for personal challenge and recognition. Rumors persist of goliath expeditions deep into the frozen peaks, seeking evidence of surviving ancient beasts—some say as a spiritual quest, others believe as a way to restore a long-lost guardian of their people.

# Humans

During the time of the ancient civilizations, human societies were widespread across the known world. Known for their versatility and adaptability, humans quickly learned to coexist with other species, often without conflict. Even after the collapse of those great societies, humans enduredâ€”reshaped by generations of exposure to unstable environments, lost technologies, and the realities of a fractured world. Today, humans are found in nearly every settlement, taking on roles in trade, logistics, infrastructure, and production. Many are skilled artisans, merchants, or engineers, helping to keep the machinery of society running. Others seek lives beyond the bounds of civilization, joining research guilds, exploration crews, or independent hunting parties as field technicians, handlers, or archaeologists. Their communities often serve as hubs for communication and commerce, connecting scattered regions across the world through practical labor and restless ambition.

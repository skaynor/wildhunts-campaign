# Elves

Elves are considered one of the oldest surviving peoples from before the fall of civilization—descendants of those who first aligned themselves with the planet’s natural systems rather than its machines. Designed or adapted to thrive in organic environments, elves developed cultures that emphasized long-term thinking, sustainability, and a deep understanding of biological and ecological processes. Many still live in reclaimed wilderness zones, maintaining isolated communities that blend seamlessly with their surroundings. Others, however, abandoned the forests long ago in favor of ordered settlements and structured study. This cultural split created lasting tension, but also innovation. Wherever they settle, elves are known for their precision, quiet intensity, and a mindset shaped by centuries of memory. Whether in the depths of the overgrowth or the towers of the rebuilt world, they remain watchful stewards of both past and future.

## High Elves

High elves are known for their long-standing tradition of intellectual pursuit, arcane study, and cultural refinement. With a natural affinity for controlled environments and systems of knowledge, their communities are often found in structured, high-tech settlements where preservation of data, architecture, and history is prioritized above all else. High elves commonly dedicate their lives to research, education, and maintaining the infrastructure that remains from past ages. Many serve as analysts, archivists, or field scholars who travel to the frontier before returning to pass along what they’ve learned.

While high elves maintain respectful relations with other elven groups and most major races, they are known for their rigid views and pride in their own legacy. Their disdain for their subterranean kin—the drow—runs deep, rooted in ideological betrayal and long-standing cultural fractures. High elves often view drow society as a threat to stability, and many actively work to undermine any resurgence of their influence. For high elves, the protection of knowledge and the order of their society come second only to ensuring that such threats never rise unchecked again.

## Wood Elves

Wood elves have long lived on the edges of civilization, choosing to remain close to the overgrown wilderness and forgotten biospheres that others abandoned or paved over. Their nomadic clans are known for their expertise in tracking, hunting, and survival—skills honed over generations of navigating unstable environments and shifting ecosystems. Many wood elves take up roles as wilderness scouts, field medics, or ecological guides, especially in remote settlements and research outposts. They are often seen as the silent protectors of these wild zones, acting not as owners of the land, but as stewards and teachers to those willing to learn.

A typical wood elf’s life is closely tied to the rhythms of the land. Long stretches of time are spent in travel, hunting for food, or observing environmental changes across biomes. For many, this connection is not just practical but spiritual—time in the wild is both livelihood and personal sanctuary. When not engaged in their work, wood elves often retreat to high perches or tree-born shelters, where they rest, reflect, and commune quietly with the world they’ve chosen to protect.

## Drow Elves

Drow are a reclusive and often distrusted offshoot of elvenkind, known for their long exile beneath the surface. Their origin lies in a radical break from high elven society during a time of social collapse, when a powerful faction chose to abandon traditional values in pursuit of knowledge, control, and forbidden power. Driven underground, their descendants adapted to a world of darkness and scarcity. Over generations, they were reshaped by their environment—skin turned ashen, hair lost its color, and their eyes developed a haunting glow suited to the endless night. In time, they embraced a new name, a new identity, and an entirely different set of values centered on secrecy, survival, and supremacy.

Drow society is insular and brutal, driven by internal competition, hierarchical ambition, and cultural indoctrination. Strength is valued above all, and advancement often comes through betrayal or conquest. Their culture once claimed grand purposes—control over the subterranean world and vengeance against surface elves—but the infighting that defines their communities has made such goals unattainable. Their leadership encourages this instability, not for strategy, but as a form of control, ensuring no one faction ever becomes too powerful. Outsiders rarely witness drow society firsthand, and those who do seldom leave with a clear picture of its true structure or motivations.

Though few drow emerge from the depths, some choose exile from their own people. These individuals often find no welcome among the surface races, viewed with suspicion or open hostility due to the actions of their ancestors. Some wander in isolation; others seek out forgotten woodland enclaves, where acceptance might come—but only with effort and humility. A rare few attempt to make peace with the past by offering their skills to exploration guilds, security outfits, or recovery teams, hoping that their work in combating the world’s dangers can speak louder than their bloodline.

# Half-Elves

For many humans, having a half-elf child is seen as a rare and welcome event—something that brings prestige, admiration, or even a sense of elevated status within their community. These children often grow up surrounded by affection and high expectations, raised with the belief that they represent a bridge between peoples. It is uncommon for half-elves raised in human communities to leave their families behind. Most stay to inherit family trades, join local administrations, or find work in respected fields such as logistics, education, or commerce. Those who do feel the pull of something greater—an urge for movement, learning, or freedom—often find that urge satisfied through guilds, research teams, or long-range exploration contracts.

Among elven cultures, however, the perception of half-elves varies widely. Forest-bound enclaves generally welcome them, seeing half-elves as an extension of the world’s ongoing evolution. In these places, half-elves are taught traditional arts, old philosophies, and ecological practices. Conversely, high-elven societies—especially those rooted in controlled environments or knowledge-restricted cities—see half-elves as impure. Their mixed heritage is seen as a dilution of lineage, and while not openly rejected, they are rarely treated as equals. In these societies, half-elves often serve in menial or administrative roles, rarely allowed access to the inner circles of magical or political power, though some rise quietly through personal merit.

Among the more secretive or militant elven factions, such as the subterranean enclaves or shadow-bound circles, half-elves are unheard of—or unwanted. These groups see interbreeding as weakness and any deviation from their bloodlines as a threat to be purged. While there are no widely known records of half-elves born from these societies, rumors persist. Should such an individual ever surface, they would likely be hunted by both sides of their lineage. The only hope for survival—and acceptance—would lie in the wilder, more open-minded elven communities that still believe in kinship over blood.

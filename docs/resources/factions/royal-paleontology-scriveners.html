<p>The Royal Paleontology Scriveners are a group of scholars and researchers dedicated to studying and observing the ecologies of various monster species creatures. Their work involves collecting and analyzing fossils, reconstructing the skeletal structures of monsters, and piecing together the evolutionary history of these creatures. They use their knowledge to inform the wider community about the behaviors, habitats, and weaknesses of these monsters, providing valuable insights that can help hunters take on new challenges in the field. The Royal Paleontology Scriveners are an essential part of the wider research community, and their work helps to deepen our understanding of the world and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The knowledge obtained by the Royal Paleontology Scriveners is relayed to the Elder Dragon Observation Team, who then publishes this information in Hunting Insights Magazine, a monthly publication sold to hunters to keep them abreast of the latest findings. Additionally, new discoveries are compiled into encyclopedias for wider distribution.</p>

<p>A hunter of the Royal Paleontology Scriveners in Monster Hunter is a highly skilled researcher and adventurer who is dedicated to the study of monsters and their environment. These hunters are responsible for conducting field research, collecting fossils, and studying the remains of monsters. They use their expertise to analyze monsters weaknesses, classify fossils, reconstruct skeletons, and piece together the evolutionary history of these extinct creatures. Depending on their specialization, they may focus on a particular area of paleontology, such as the study of fossils from a specific environment or time period. They may also specialize in a particular skill, such as paleontological illustration, where they create detailed drawings and reconstructions of ancient creatures based on fossil evidence. Hunters of the Royal Paleontology Scriveners are an essential part of the wider research community in Monster Hunter, and their work helps to deepen our understanding of the world and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of information about a creature mentioned by someone or that you have encountered, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from the hunter&#x27;s guild, dragon observation team, wycademy, or a scrivener or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets reclusive or unknown monsters of the world can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</p>

<p>As a member of the Royal Paleontology Scriveners in the Monster Hunter world, you would likely be a valuable asset to any hunting party due to your extensive knowledge of monster behavior and weaknesses. Your role would be to provide insight and guidance to the hunters, using your expertise to help them develop effective strategies for taking down their quarry.</p>
<p>During a hunt, you would likely stay at a safe distance from the monsters (though this is not always the case), observing their behavior and taking notes on their strengths and weaknesses. You might use your knowledge to help the hunters identify weak points on the monster&#x27;s body or develop tactics for avoiding dangerous attacks.</p>
<p>Outside of combat, you would likely be responsible for analyzing the data collected during hunts and updating the Royal Paleontology Scriveners&#x27; database on monster behavior. This information would be invaluable to future hunting parties, and could help improve the efficiency and success of future hunts.</p>
<p>Overall, your role as a member of the Royal Paleontology Scriveners would be to support and augment the abilities of the hunters, helping them to succeed in their dangerous and challenging work.</p>

<p>The Royal Paleontology Scriveners are also well-known to travel in groups and work in the natural habitats of monsters in order to either study their ecosystem or discover new species. In these groups, they are protected from monsters by their own personal guards. However, sometimes the guards aren&#x27;t enough to protect the researchers from monsters so the Hunter&#x27;s Guild is known to request some hunters to accompany them for extra protection.</p>

Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of the Head Scrivener.

<p>The Hunter&#x27;s Guild is the central governing body within the Monster Hunter universe. The Hunter&#x27;s Guild unifies and regulates all hunting activities on which many people make their living. The guild aggregates hunting and gathering requests from far and wide, and posts them within their gathering halls and outposts throughout the land for professional hunters to undertake. These &quot;quests&quot; can have many purposes, including defense of citizens or towns, or research into monster anatomy and biology. The Hunter&#x27;s Guild is also well-known for preventing poaching. Any unsanctioned hunting is illegal to the Hunter&#x27;s Guild and can lead to a multitude of punishments, but most commonly death at the hand of a Guild Knight.</p>
<p>The Hunter&#x27;s Guild headquarters are located in the city of Dundorma, and all major announcements and actions are made from this location. Beyond this, the Hunter&#x27;s Guild commands a sprawling territory comprising many districts located in a multitude of regions. Each district has a guild master that manages the district, though not all of them are the best managers. Hunter&#x27;s Guild-certified gathering halls can be found in all major city centers such as the ones noted above. Smaller Hunter&#x27;s Guild outposts, commonly set up in less populous and more remote towns and villages, such as Pokke Village, Moga Village, or Yukumo Village, and are handled by one or more Hunter&#x27;s Guild-employed representatives. These smaller outposts are considered to be a part of the larger districts in which they are located.</p>
<p>Though the Hunter&#x27;s Guild is connected together, each district of it prefers to work alone. This means that not every district is aware of new discoveries made by the other, such as locations and monsters.</p>

<p>The Hunter&#x27;s Guild crest has four symbols on it. Each symbol on the crest has a meaning that the Hunter&#x27;s Guild follows. The north represents Respect for nature, the west represents Life as a community, the south represents Crafting from nature, and the east represents Prosperity from nature.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fate-of-most-captured-monsters">Fate of Most Captured Monsters<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fate of Most Captured Monsters" title="Direct link to Fate of Most Captured Monsters" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#fate-of-most-captured-monsters">​</a></h3>
<p>Usually when a monster is captured, it is torn apart in its sleep with ease by the corporation that requested it. This is due to said corporation wanting to research the body parts and organs of said monster, allowing them to better understand a certain species. The corporations that request for monsters to be captured include Elder Dragon Observation Team, Wycademy, and the Royal Paleontology Scriveners. Only on some rare occasions, is the monster tamed and becomes a person&#x27;s pet.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="goal-of-the-hunters-guild">Goal of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goal of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild" title="Direct link to Goal of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#goal-of-the-hunters-guild">​</a></h2>
<p>The Hunter&#x27;s Guild doesn&#x27;t exist to annihilate all monsters, they exist to harmonize society with nature. Their primary goal is to prevent further damage to the monster populations, so they can prevent other monster species from going extinct like some ancient species. However, if a monster threatens lives, towns, cities, etc, then hunters are allowed to hunt it to prevent destruction. If the monster is rare, the guild will sometimes seek to repel the monster rather than kill it. The Hunter&#x27;s Guild also seeks to minimize poaching. Any kill or capture unsanctioned by the Hunter&#x27;s Guild is illegal in the eyes of the guild. Poaching can lead to a multitude of punishments, but most commonly death at the hand of a Guild Knight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hunter&#x27;s Guild is responsible for discovering and determining specific hunting grounds throughout the land. Only when a swath of area is officially within the guild&#x27;s jurisdiction can it be embarked upon for the purposes of undertaking quests. Even despite this, the guild will sometimes only allow hunters within a specific city or region to accept certain quests.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hunter’s Guild seeks to rid the world of the monsters that succumb to corruption. These creatures are treated with the highest priority and are one of the few creatures allowed to be killed outside of a hunting ground.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hierarchy-of-the-guild">Hierarchy of the Guild<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hierarchy of the Guild" title="Direct link to Hierarchy of the Guild" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#hierarchy-of-the-guild">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guild-masters">Guild Masters<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guild Masters" title="Direct link to Guild Masters" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#guild-masters">​</a></h3>
<p>Guild masters are the leaders of their district. Beyond bureaucratic work, they mainly help hunters register into the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, in order to let them hunt legally under this corporation and test a hunter&#x27;s strength. They are known to test a hunter&#x27;s strength with Urgent Quests in order to see if the hunter is worthy of ranking up. Guild masters are also known to give the hunters various types of advice to help them overcome challenges.</p>
<p>Under the laws set by His Immenseness, the guild master job/title is limited only to wyverians and elves. There are currently four known guild masters located in Dundorma, Loc Lac, Minegarde, and Val Harbor, each a wyverian, responsible for their own districts.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guild-managers">Guild Managers<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guild Managers" title="Direct link to Guild Managers" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#guild-managers">​</a></h3>
<p>The guild managers are much like the guild masters, helping hunters register into the Hunter&#x27;s Guild and providing various types of advice to help them overcome challenges. In addition to their Hunter&#x27;s Guild responsibilities., the guild managers act like mayors of the town or village they live in, answering only to the guild master in the district where they reside. The guild manager job is also limited to elves and wyverians.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guild-knights">Guild Knights<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guild Knights" title="Direct link to Guild Knights" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#guild-knights">​</a></h3>
<p>The main job of a guild knight is to hunt down poachers, other illegal hunters, and wanted murderers; bringing them to justice, typically by killing them. This also applies to hunters that break the rules of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild. If an emergency situation happens during their post, guild knights try to keep order by acting as leaders. Guild knights have also been known to act as negotiators for settlements and collect info on monsters unknown to the public.</p>
<p>In each district and outpost of the Hunter’s Guild, there can be at least twelve guild knights in one location at a time, though there can sometimes be less. Who the guild knights are is mostly unknown to the common members of the guild. Preferring to keep their job a secret, many of the guild knights do other jobs within the guild, acting as receptionists, hunters, teachers, or merchants.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guild-receptionists">Guild Receptionists<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guild Receptionists" title="Direct link to Guild Receptionists" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#guild-receptionists">​</a></h3>
<p>Since monster hunting is a popular job among the world and the geography of the world being mostly unknown, along with its history, a special few individuals have the job of collecting information. This information is not only about an area but the monsters that inhabit it. It is the guild receptionist&#x27;s job to give hunters quests and to inform them about any monsters within their rank. The job mainly allows females to be guild receptionists, however, some males can be qualified as one too.</p>
<p>The uniforms are different for each district for guild receptionists. Some uniforms are perfect for going to many different environments, others just make it easier to move from place to place while on the job. Many handlers chose to become receptionists after retiring from the field.</p>

<p>In order to undertake guild-sponsored quests, you must first register yourself as an official Monster Hunter under the Hunter&#x27;s Guild. Following this, you are sent to a training school where you undergo rigorous physical and mental training. Afterwards you are given a specific measure of personal skill or &quot;Hunter Rank&quot; (often shortened to HR), based on how well you do in the training.</p>

<p>A hunter rank is how the Hunter&#x27;s Guild can gauge one&#x27;s ability to undertake varying levels of hunting requests. In accordance with this, the guild will assign rankings, often on a number-of-stars basis, to quests listings to ensure that dangerous or difficult quests are only embarked upon by skilled hunters who have proven their aptitude. This is both to ensure the safety of its hunters and to ensure that the request is properly completed.</p>
<p>If hunters are extremely skilled, they will sometimes be sent to do secret requests or investigations for extremely dangerous monsters. They will do these quests secretly so it won&#x27;t cause a panic to the public, in order to get a better understanding of said situation, because in some cases it is just a false alarm, and so the Hunter&#x27;s Guild can come up with the proper actions needed to protect the truth or the public without causing a panic.</p>

<p>Each hunter is also given a Guild Card that they can customize at their own free will. They are used as an ID for hunters to list their name, awards they&#x27;ve collected, and the monsters they have slain. These cards can be made out of various materials like timber, ore, and monster materials. The Guild Cards of some elite hunters are known to be made of parts belonging to more dangerous monsters, such as Nargacuga scales and the shell of Zinogre. Some legendary hunters have cards made out of Elder Dragon materials. Each hunter is known to have their own personalized title given to them by their guildmaster.</p>

<p>Your guild will provide you with food and accommodation if necessary. You have access to a guild hall if one is present (located in most cities, towns, and villages). The guild will support you in legal matters, so long as your rank is high enough and you are in good standing with the guild, and is a good way to gain introduction to influential members of society. Connections made through the guild for personal reasons may require a donation to the guild coffers. The guild requires dues of 5gp a month or at least one completed hunt per month.</p>

<p>As a member of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, your primary goal is to prevent untoward damage to the monster populations, while providing a service and protection to society. Due to this, you are expected to keep tabs on the monster populations in areas and report any strange events to the guild leaders. The laws also prevent you from taking the same quest more than once, unless it is necessary. However, if a monster threatens lives, towns, cities, etc. then you are allowed to hunt it to prevent destruction, even if the monster is rare.</p>
<p>As a hunter, handler, guild knight, or other role, you will spend most of your time completing bounties and other requests as a way to make a living within the guild. A hunter initiate is the core role in the hunters guild where you might strive to become like one of the hunters of legends, or perhaps to seek to preserve the balance in nature. It is not uncommon for you to take the scout role on a hunt. As a handler initiate you are typically the caretaker of the group. You might spend most of your down time in the books learning as much as you can about the creatures in the area, or in shops buying up new supplies to ease the difficulty of an upcoming hunt. It is not uncommon for you to take the artisan or spotter roles on a hunt.</p>
<p>As a guild knight you are charged with enforcing the laws of the guild, on the streets or in the wilds. When you aren&#x27;t off on a hunt, you most likely spend your time rooting out poachers or members of the cult of Fatalis. It is not uncommon for you to take the spotter role on a hunt</p>

<p>An adventuring party made up entirely of Hunter&#x27;s Guild members could be a specialized team dedicated to the preservation of nature and society. A hunter initiate (a rogue or ranger) and a guild knight apprentice (fighter, or paladin) would form the core of the party, supported by a handler (cleric or druid) who helps direct their missions.</p>

<p>A member of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild gains renown typically when they complete dangerous hunts, discover new information about creatures, or prevent something from disrupting nature&#x27;s balance, such as poachers. By gaining renown as a member of the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, you can advance your hunter rank within the guild. Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of the guild master. Advancement is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.</p>

<p><em>Prerequisite: Renown 1 or higher in the Hunter&#x27;s Guild</em></p>
<p>Having completed your first dangerous hunt, the guild recognizes you as a true hunter. Your rank allows you to take on higher difficulty hunts and the guild provides you with a home and a modest living wage while you are in a town or village where a guild hall can be found. The guild also provides you with supplies you need to complete those missions (within reason) and access to their guild store.</p>

<p><em>Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, 4th level or higher</em></p>
<p>At this rank, you have begun to make a name for yourself and as such the guild provides you with access to purchase CR 2 or lower materials that the guild store offers (<em>DMs choice of what materials and when the stock changes</em>). Additionally you are given a lynian caretaker for your home and even though they may not go hunt in the field with you, it is not unheard of for a caretaker to give its hunter gifts when they return from a hunt.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hr-3">HR 3<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to HR 3" title="Direct link to HR 3" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/hunters-guild#hr-3">​</a></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, 8th level or higher</em></p>
<p>At HR 3, you are responsible for hunting some of the more dangerous monsters in the world when they become a threat to a settlement or the ecosystem it is located in. As such, you are given access to the guilds wingdrakes (<em>see page 191 of the MHMM for its stat block</em>) or other mounts for faster travel between locations. Additionally, the guild grants you permission to purchase CR 4 or lower materials that the guild store offers (<em>DMs choice of what materials and when the stock changes</em>).</p>

<p><em>Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Hunter&#x27;s Guild, 12th level or higher</em></p>
<p>As a HR 4, you are an elite hunter and given access to G ranked hunts (<em>hunts kept hidden from the populace for their own safety and to prevent panic should the knowledge get out</em>) and other secret information hidden away by the guild. As an elite hunter your words and actions reflect immensely on the guild, but also carry an immeasurable weight with them. As such, nobles and other members of high society treat you with great respect, unless you prove yourself untrustworthy.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg"

<p>The Talon Society is a secretive organization of poachers who are known to specialize in hunting rare and exotic creatures. They operate in the shadows, avoiding the authorities and conducting their illegal activities under the cover of darkness. They are motivated by profit and are willing to go to great lengths to secure valuable trophies, which can fetch high prices on the black market. They are skilled hunters and trackers, often employing traps and other means to capture their prey alive. The Talon members are notorious for their disregard of wildlife conservation and have been known to cause significant damage to the ecosystem. Despite the risks involved in their line of work, membership in the society is highly sought after, as it offers lucrative rewards and the chance to become one of the most successful poachers in the land.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="role-of-the-talon-society">Role of the Talon Society<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Role of the Talon Society" title="Direct link to Role of the Talon Society" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#role-of-the-talon-society">​</a></h2>
<p>The Talon Society&#x27;s main goal is to capture rare and exotic creatures for profit. They are known for their expertise in tracking and capturing these creatures, and have been hired by wealthy collectors and traders from all over the world. The society is also responsible for collecting and selling rare materials from the creatures they capture, such as scales, fur, and horns.</p>
<p>In order to capture these rare creatures, the Talon Society uses a variety of techniques and equipment, including traps, poisons, and specialized weapons. They are constantly innovating and experimenting with new methods to increase their success rate.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="poachers-of-the-talon-society">Poachers of the Talon Society<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Poachers of the Talon Society" title="Direct link to Poachers of the Talon Society" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#poachers-of-the-talon-society">​</a></h2>
<p>The Talon Society is a group of skilled poachers who specialize in hunting and capturing rare and valuable monsters. They are known to infiltrate the Hunters Guild and gather information on rare creatures to pass along to the Talon Society. They seek to steal knowledge from the Hunters Guild by theft or by accessing sites of ancient technology.</p>
<p>Using this knowledge, they develop their own tools and magics to make their job easier. The Talon Society believes that they have the right to hunt and capture any monster they desire, regardless of the laws and regulations of the land. Their ultimate goal is to accumulate as much wealth and power as possible by exploiting the resources provided by these creatures.</p>

<p>Raxis is the leader of the Talon Society and is considered to be the best poacher in the group. However, Raxis is not just any ordinary poacher. He is a lich and champion of the Lord of Bones, and his true goal is to punish those who do not fear and respect death. Many members of the hunters guild do not respect death, taking jobs to gather rare scales or kill monsters for trivial reasons, such as killing a monster because it won&#x27;t move out of their way. Raxis believes they all need to learn the value of life and death, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to teach them. His appearance is similar to the avatar of the Lord of Bones, with a skeletal figure hidden in flowing black robes. He speaks in a high whisper, conveying no emotion.</p>

<p>Talon Knights are the elite hunters of the Talon Society and are hand-picked by Raxis for their exceptional skills. They are trained in a variety of techniques to capture and subdue their prey, including magic and conventional traps, poison, and other tools of the trade. Talon Knights are responsible for training new recruits and maintaining the society&#x27;s equipment. They are also tasked with carrying out Raxis&#x27;s orders, which can sometimes be extreme. They are some of the only members of the Talon Society that are aware that Raxis is a lich.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="talon-members">Talon Members<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Talon Members" title="Direct link to Talon Members" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-members">​</a></h3>
<p>Talon Members are experienced poachers who have proven their worth to Raxis and have been granted full membership into the society. They are responsible for carrying out missions and assisting the Talon Knights in their duties. Talon Members are also responsible for reporting any valuable information they obtain from their poaching activities to the talon knights, who uses this knowledge to further Raxis and their own goals.</p>

<p>Talon Recruits are new members of the society who are still learning the ropes. More often than not, these recruits join up due to the rumors the spoils and riches they might receive as a member of the Talon Society. They are tasked with assisting the Talon Knights on missions and are trained in basic poaching techniques. Recruits must prove themselves before they can be promoted to Talon Knight or Talon Member status.</p>

<p>As a member of the Talon Society, your primary goal is to hunt creatures for profit while avoiding detection from the authorities. Due to this, you are expected to keep your hunting activities hidden and operate within the shadows. You may also be tasked with stealing rare creatures from protected areas and delivering them to wealthy clients.</p>
<p>As a member of the Talon Society, you will spend time between hunts on gathering information about your targets, such as their location and weaknesses, and on forging connections with wealthy clients who are interested in purchasing rare creatures. You may also need to invest in equipment and weapons that can aid in your hunting and poaching activities.</p>
<p>Self-preservation is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to protect yourself from authorities or other rival poaching groups - whether it&#x27;s learning new survival skills or developing connections with influential people - makes you a more efficient poacher and increases your chances of success.</p>

<p>Unless you are playing a chaotic or evil campaign an adventuring party will almost never consist of all talon society members. Instead you might have one talon member that infiltrated a hunting group. On the off chance it is a full party of talon society members, it is possible one of those members is actually infiltrating the talon society and working for the Hunter&#x27;s Guild.</p>

<p>In the Talon Society, members can gain rank and renown through various means, but one of the most significant ways is by bringing in valuable prey through poaching. Successfully capturing and delivering rare and exotic creatures can earn a member prestige and recognition within the society, leading to promotions and higher ranks.</p>
<p>Members can also gain rank and renown by completing missions assigned by the society, as well as by demonstrating their skills and loyalty through service to the society. Those who show exceptional cunning and resourcefulness in the field, whether through poaching or other means, can rise through the ranks quickly and earn the respect of their peers.</p>
<p>However, it&#x27;s important to note that poaching without the approval of the society is strictly forbidden, and can result in severe consequences such as expulsion from the society or even death. The Talon Society values secrecy and discretion, and members must be careful to only target creatures that have been designated as acceptable prey by the society&#x27;s leadership.</p>

<p><em>Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Talon Society</em></p>
<p>As someone starting out in the Talon Society, you would begin as a Talon recruit. Your main role would involve learning the fundamentals of poaching and hunting, as well as becoming knowledgeable about the different types of creatures that the society targets. Your duties may include scouting and gathering information on potential hunting grounds, identifying valuable targets, and supporting higher- ranked members of the society on their hunts.</p>
<p>As a Talon recruit, you may also be expected to assist with other tasks such as maintaining equipment, caring for captured creatures, and helping with the transportation of goods and materials. The ultimate goal for a Talon recruit is to prove your worth and rise through the ranks of the society to gain more prestige and renown within the organization.</p>
<p>At this rank, you are provided with an income to satisfy a modest lifestyle... so long as your last mission was a success.</p>

<p><em>Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 25 or higher in the Talon Society</em></p>
<p>As someone who is part of the Talon Society, your primary responsibility as a talon member would be to carry out tasks related to poaching and trafficking exotic creatures. This could include identifying valuable targets, tracking and capturing them, and ensuring their safe transportation to buyers. You might also be tasked with training and overseeing new recruits, ensuring that they follow the Society&#x27;s values and code.</p>
<p>Since the Talon Society operates in secrecy, it&#x27;s important for members to avoid detection by authorities and other rival factions. To do this, you might need to cultivate a network of contacts and informants and utilize covert methods to stay hidden.</p>
<p>When you reach the rank of member, you are provided with a monster hunter weapon of your choice. The Weapon. This weapon can be either uncommon or rare. When going on missions that requires you to stay away from home for a period of a week or longer, the talon knight you serve under may provide you with locations of safehouses and hidden caches for storing or obtaining poaching equipment.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rank-3-talon-knight-special-role">Rank 3: Talon Knight (Special Role)<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rank 3: Talon Knight (Special Role)" title="Direct link to Rank 3: Talon Knight (Special Role)" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#rank-3-talon-knight-special-role">​</a></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 40 or higher in the Talon Society</em></p>
<p>To become a Talon Knight, you must first become a highly respected and skilled member of the Talon Society. This requires years of dedicated service, exceptional hunting and poaching skills, and a deep understanding of the Society&#x27;s values and code.</p>
<p>Once you have achieved a high level of renown and respect within the Society, you may be considered for the position of Talon Knight. However, it&#x27;s important to note that there can only ever be five Talon Knights at any given time, and they are not replaced until they die. This means that the position is highly coveted and very difficult to attain.</p>
<p>To increase your chances of being considered for the position, it&#x27;s essential to maintain a close relationship with the current Talon Knights, as they are the ones who ultimately choose who will take their place. It&#x27;s also important to show a willingness to carry out the will of Raxis, even if it means deviating from the Society&#x27;s normal tasks.</p>
<p>Overall, becoming a Talon Knight is a long and difficult process that requires unwavering dedication and exceptional skills. But for those who are able to achieve this esteemed position, it is a great honor and a mark of true mastery in the art of poaching and hunting.</p>
<p>In this role, you are advised and in regular communication with Raxis, who places you in charge of a major territory and all talon members residing within. You might be tasked with obtaining rare or valuable specimens, sabotaging or disrupting the activities of rival factions, to gather information on their plans and operations, eliminating individuals or groups that pose a threat to the Talon Society, or special assignments that are particularly challenging or sensitive missions that require your unique talents and expertise.</p>
<p>You continue to draw a salary sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/helix-commission"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Helix Commission</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/other-factions"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Other Factions and Backgrounds</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#role-of-the-talon-society">Role of the Talon Society</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#poachers-of-the-talon-society">Poachers of the Talon Society</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#hierarchy-of-the-talon-society">Hierarchy of the Talon Society</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#raxis-the-everliving">Raxis the Everliving</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-knights">Talon Knights</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-members">Talon Members</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-recruits">Talon Recruits</a></li></ul></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-society-characters">Talon Society Characters</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#joining-the-talon-society">Joining the Talon Society</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-society-spells">Talon Society Spells</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#talon-society-backgrounds">Talon Society Backgrounds</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#feature-talon-network">Feature: Talon Network</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#poacher-1">Poacher</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#infiltrator">Infiltrator</a></li></ul></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#how-do-i-fit-in">How do I Fit In?</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#a-talon-society-party">A Talon Society Party</a></li></ul></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#rank-and-renown">Rank and Renown</a><ul><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#rank-1-talon-recruit">Rank 1: Talon Recruit</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#rank-2-talon-memberr">Rank 2: Talon MemberR</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/factions/talon-society#rank-3-talon-knight-special-role">Rank 3: Talon Knight (Special Role)</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>

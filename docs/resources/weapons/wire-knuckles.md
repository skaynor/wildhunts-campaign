**Compatible Proficiency:** Any
**Compatible Weapon Mastery:** Nick, Push, Sap, Slow, Vex *(One for each hand)*

*Infused with the essence of wirebugs and the strength of ironsilk, these knuckles offer unparalleled agility and graceful maneuvers, seamlessly blending combat finesse with versatile utility and support capabilities.*

## Uncommon

**Empowered Strikes.** If your unarmed strikes deal at least 1d4 damage or more, this weapon deals that damage +2.

**Wiredash.** Harnessing your expertise with wirebugs, you've honed the skill to swiftly evade harm. As a reaction when taking damage or when you succeed on a saving throw to resist an effect that would inflict a status condition, you can move up to 10 feet in any direction of your choice. During this movement, you ignore difficult terrain and don't provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Wirefall.** While you are falling, you can use your reaction to throw your wirebug above you, stopping your descent in mid-air until the start of your next turn. When you begin your fall again, the height you stopped at is the new value use for the amount of fall damage you take. You can use this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Rare

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

**Silkbind.** Immediately after you hit a creature during your attack action, you can use your bonus action to slam your fist against the ground, planting a wire into the earth that wraps around the creature, binding it within a 15-foot radius from the wire's point of placement. The creature can't move beyond this radius until the wire is snapped.

**Wiredash Upgrade.** You can now move up to 15 feet in any direction.

**Wirefall Upgrade.** You can now expend two uses of wirefall to cast the *feather fall* spell.

## Very Rare

*You gain a +2 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

**Wyvern Ride (1/Short Rest).** You can attempt to influence the actions of a creature on its turn, provided the creature is at least one size category larger than you and you are grappling it. As an action, make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the grappled creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). On a success, the silkbind breaks, and you can choose one of the following effects:

- *Forced Movement.* On its turn, the creature moves up to its speed in any direction of your choice, triggering opportunity attacks as normal. The movement must be within the creature's capability, such as flying if it possesses wings.
- *Directed Attack.* On its turn, you compel the creature to make a single weapon attack (as part of its multiattack if it has one) against a target you select within its attack range.
- *Ramming Maneuver.* On its turn, the creature uses its movement to crash into a nearby solid object (such as a wall or tree) of your choice. The creature takes 1d8 damage for every 10 feet it moved (damage type determined by the object).

Once the effect ends, the grapple ends, and both you and the creature fall prone. Once used, you can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Silkbind Upgrade.** The radius the creature can move while silkbound is reduced to 10 feet and the save DC increases by +1.

## Legendary

*You gain a +3 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

**Wyvern Ride Upgrade.** You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks when using wyvern riding and if you beat the grappled creature by 5 or more, the grapple doesn't end and you don't fall prone.

Additionally, the following options for this property change as follows:

- *Directed Attack.* You compel the creature to make a two weapon attacks instead of one.
- *Ramming Maneuver.* The creature takes 1d10 damage for every 10 feet it moved (damage type determined by the object).

**Wiredash Upgrade.** You can now move up to 20 feet in any direction.

**Silkbind Upgrade.** The save DC now increases by +2 instead of +1.

# Tonfas

*Martial or Simple Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Club, Flail, Handaxe, Light Hammer, Mace, Quarterstaff, Warhammer
**Compatible Weapon Mastery:** Nick, Push, Sap, Slow, Topple, Vex *(One for each tonfa)*

*The Tonfa is made up of two light, swift poles with a propulsion system. Due to this, hunters can easily evade while the weapon is drawn and even propel themselves from the ground.*

## Nonmagical

*25 gp, 1d6 bludgeoning, 4 lb., light. For each Tonfa.*

## Uncommon

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

**Dragon Spirit.** When you attack a hostile creature with this weapon, you gain 1 spirit (maximum of 5). You lose all spirit, if you don't attack a target by the end of your next turn. You can expend spirit on the following weapon properties:

- *Earth Style.* As a bonus action, you can expend 2 spirit to increase your tonfas weapon damage die to a d8 until the end of your next turn.
- *Propel.* As a bonus action, you can expend 1 spirit to launch yourself 10 feet into the air. Until the end of your next turn you gain a fly speed of 10 feet (hover). You can't fly any higher than 10 feet above the ground from this property.

## Rare

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls; and +1 AC while wielding both tonfas.*

**Dragon Spirit Upgrade.** Your maximum spirit increases by 1 (maximum of 6) and you can expend your spirit on the following options in addition to all previous rarities options:

- *Propel Upgrade.* You no longer have a maximum height you can be above the ground with this property.
- *Air Dash.* When you are flying and a creature enters a space within your reach for the first time on a turn, you can use your reaction to expend 1 spirit and fly up to 10 feet away (without provoking opportunity attacks) from the creature.
- *Dragon Spirit Piercing Attack.* As an action, you can expend 6 spirit to quickly jab with both tonfas, sending a blast of tremendous force in a 15-foot line, that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency bonus, taking 2d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If a Huge or larger creature is in 10 feet or more of the line's area, the damage that creature takes is doubled. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, the dragon spirit piercing attack replaces one of them. Once used, you can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Very Rare

# Equipment Basics

## Starting Equipment

When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background as per usual with a standard D&D game, as well as proficiency in one Monster Hunter weapon of your choosing. Your class may provide you with the proficiencies needed for another weapon as well, but you will have one preferred weapon regardless of these class proficiencies. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in [Guide to Monster Hunting](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCk9FgQaqaXBVmLeCeT) or in the [Player's Handbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10elvJ7bM_YyGaGt_xAIZFyr9aGkBPpEu&usp=drive_fs). See the Starting Wealth by Class table (PHB p.143) to determine how much gold you have to spend. You decide how your character came by this starting equipment.

:::note
While you can start with any items from the [Guide to Monster Hunting](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCk9FgQaqaXBVmLeCeT), you cannot start with any Monster Hunter weapons or monster materials.

### Wealth

Wealth in this campaign is the same as in a standard D&D universe.

#### Attunement

When you finish a Short or Long rest you can attune to one weapon, one armor, and two trinkets. You cannot attune to multiple weapons or armor, and only one attuned trinket is active at a time, granting you the material effect placed inside of it. As an action, you can swap between which trinket is active.

An unattuned armor or weapon acts as a common version of the weapon no matter its rarity; preventing the use of the weapon properties it gained from the rarity increase. Additionally, any materials in these unattuned armor or weapons are disabled until attuned.

## Armor

Armor in this campaign is comprised of all nonmagical armor in the [Player's Handbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10elvJ7bM_YyGaGt_xAIZFyr9aGkBPpEu&usp=drive_fs) (p.145) and uses the standard rules for the armor. A PC at level 1 starts with the armor in their starting equipment of their class. This armor can be enhanced using materials you obtain while out on a hunt. They usually have the look and feel of the monsters utilized to enhance the armor.

### Rarity

There are 5 rarities of armor in Monster Hunter: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. Each rarity has a number of slots the hunter can use to place monster materials in. These monster materials enchant their armor with magical effects.

When your armor's rarity increases to rare and above, choose one of the following properties it gains: +1 bonus to your AC, +1 to two skills of your choice, +1 to a chosen saving throw, or +1 to all saving throws you are not proficient with. You can pick the same bonus each time your armor's rarity increases or a different one if that is your preference.

#### Rarity slots

Common (1 Slot)  
Uncommon (2 Slots)  
Rare (3 Slots)  
Very Rare (4 Slots)  
Legendary (5 Slots)

### Rules

Below you will find a set of rules that limit the materials that
you can place in your armor, to provide a fair and balanced
game:

1. Your armor can only have one damage reduction, resistance, or immunity to any one damage type.
2. Your armor can only have one advantage or immunity vs a condition such as poisoned, frightened, or prone.
3. Your armor can only have one material that grants a bonus to AC.
4. Your armor can only have one effect that uses runes.
5. A material can only be replaced with another material. Once replaced the previous material is destroyed.
6. Materials do not stack with improved versions of their effects, including unnamed materials (IE: detect does not stack with detect+).

### Clothing

A class that does not use armor such as a barbarian, monk, or some spellcasters can choose a piece of clothing as their armor. For example, this could be a robe, a tunic, or a loincloth. This armor provides no AC increase, but they can have their rarity upgrade the same way as a normal piece of armor can be to increase the material slots for magical effects.

### Upgrading your armor

When you want to upgrade your armor consult the table below. Once you have the correct number of resources, you can upgrade your armor for the cost listed.

| **Rarity** | **Resource***      | **Amount Needed** | **Cost**  |
| :--------: | :----------------: | :---------------: | :-------: |
| Uncommon   | Armor Sphere       | 5                 | 500 gp    |
| Rare       | Hard Armor Sphere  | 10                | 1,500 gp  |
| Very Rare  | Heavy Armor Sphere | 15                | 6,000 gp  |
| Legendary  | Royal Armor Sphere | 20                | 24,000 gp |

*\*Some creature materials will state that it is a* ***"rarity" armor crafting material***, *these can be used in place of the resources listed in the table above.*

### Shields

Shields exist as normal but cannot be used while wielding a Monster Hunter weapon, only weapons with a provided shield can gain this bonus. Any AC bonus it may provide is increased as the weapon's rarity changes, as shown in the weapons information.

## Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor an Insect Glaive or a Heavy Bowgun, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. There are 17 types of weapons in the Monster Hunter universe: Charge Blade, Dual Blades, Great Sword, Gunlance, Hammer, Hunting Horn, Insect Glaive, Lance, Longsword, Magnet Spike, Magus Staff, Switch Axe, Sword & Shield, Tonfas, Bow, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun. You can find information about each weapon’s compatible proficiencies in the weapon section of this guide.

:::tip
I will allow you to have complete proficiency in one weapon type of your choosing, regardless of your class's granted proficiencies.
:::

### Unarmed Strikes

A character can choose to attune to an “unarmed item” instead of a weapon, such as handwraps, gauntlets, or knuckles. This item is treated as a weapon for upgrading, attunement and material placement. This item has no special properties except that it offers 1 additional material slot per rarity level. E.g. an uncommon "unarmed item" would have 3 material slots rather than 2.

### Weapon Rarity

There are 5 rarities of weapons in Monster Hunter: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. Each rarity has a number of slots the hunter can place materials into, enhancing their weapon with magical effects. Additionally, as the weapon’s rarity increases their effects also improve.

#### Weapon Rarity Slots

Common (1 Slot)  
Uncommon (2 Slots)  
Rare (3 Slots)  
Very Rare (4 Slots)  
Legendary (5 Slots)

### Weapon Rules

Below you will find a set of rules that limit the materials that you can place in your weapon, to provide a fair and balanced game:

1. A weapon can have one material that causes an effect when you roll a 20, such as critical status effect on the Fancy Beak material. This material is exempt from rule 2.
2. A weapon can only have one extra damage, condition inflicting, or on-hit effect material. The extra damage material rule doesn't apply to materials that have a requirement to deal that extra damage, such as the partbreaker effect found on the Gravios Carapace material.
3. A weapon can only have one effect that uses runes.
4. A weapon can only have one bonus to spell DC and spell attack rolls.
5. A material can only be replaced with another material. Once replaced the previous material is destroyed.
6. Materials do not stack with improved versions of their effects, including unnamed materials (IE: critical eye+1 does not stack with critical eye+2)

### Upgrading your weapon

When you want to upgrade your weapon consult the table below. Once you have the correct number of resources, you can upgrade your weapon for the cost listed.

| **Rarity** | **Resource\*** | **Amount Needed** | **Cost**  |
| :--------: | :------------: | :---------------: | :-------: |
| Uncommon   | Earth Crystal  | 5                 | 500 gp    |
| Rare       | Machalite Ore  | 10                | 1,000 gp  |
| Very Rare  | Dragonite Ore  | 15                | 4,000 gp  |
| Legendary  | Carbalite Ore  | 20                | 16,000 gp |

*\*Some creature materials will state that it is a* **"rarity" weapon crafting material**, *these can be used in place of the resources listed in the table above.*

## Trinkets

Trinkets in Monster Hunter are not just for show. They have 1 material slot that you can place a weapon or armor material into and still gain their benefit as if it was in a weapon or armor set. You can have up to two trinkets on you at a time, but you only gain the effect of one of the trinkets at a time. As an action, you can swap which trinket effect you are using. Players can choose a trinket from the [Player's Handbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10elvJ7bM_YyGaGt_xAIZFyr9aGkBPpEu&usp=drive_fs) (p.159) or perhaps a trophy from a creature they have hunted. If they do not find something they like on the list, the player can work with the GM to choose an appropriate trinket for their setting.

### Trinket Rules

If the material grants an effect such as extra damage on weapon attacks, or requires the armor to be worn, then it only works on armor or weapons you are attuned to.

## Cosmetic Material Slot

There are many materials you may find while hunting monsters. These cosmetic materials have no mechanical benefit, but change your characters appearance in some way. You have one cosmetic slot in either your armor or weapon (your choice) that you can place a cosmetic material into or replace when you find a different that suits your character a bit more.

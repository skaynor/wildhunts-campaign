# Magus Staff

*Simple Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Quarterstaff

*Used more for walking than striking a creature, the magus staves are finely crafted. Inlaid with gems and intricate carvings allowing the casting and storing of spells within them, the Magus Staff are the choice weapon for a spellcaster.*

**Arcane Interference.** Due to the magical nature of this weapon, a creature cannot wield a shield while attuned to this weapon.

## Nonmagical

*20 gp, 1d6 bludgeoning, 4 lb., Versatile (1d8).*

**Focus.** This weapon acts as a spell focus for your spellcasting.

## Uncommon

This weapon retains all previous rarities weapon properties in addition to the following:

**Spell Storing.** This staff stores Spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The staff can store up to 1 level worth of spells at a time.

Only the wielder can Cast a Spell of 1st level into the staff by touching the staff as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the staff. If the staff can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wielding this staff, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell Attack bonus, and Spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the staff is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

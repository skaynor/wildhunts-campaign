## Uncommon

**Boomerang Jump.** While holding your wyvern boomerang, your high jump distance is equal to your long jump's distance.

**Ricochet.** When the wyvern boomerang returns to you before the end of your turn, you can use your bonus action to hit it with your power gauntlets, redirecting it towards another creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The wyvern boomerang then lands in an unoccupied space next to the targeted creature and does not return to you at the end of your turn.

**Running Start.** Until the end of your turn, your wyvern boomerang's thrown range increases by 5 feet for every 10 feet you move while holding this weapon. The wyvern boomerang's normal range can't increase beyond 120 feet with this property, and its maximum range can't increase beyond 240 feet.

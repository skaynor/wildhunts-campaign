# Great Sword

*Martial Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Greatsword

*A slow, heavy weapon with massive damage potential, the Greatsword is the heavy artillery of melee weapons. While simple at first, the Greatsword requires skilled timing and spacing in order to get the most out of it. On offense, the Greatsword attacks with slow, ponderous swings that hit with precision and accuracy.*

## Nonmagical

*50 gp, 2d6 slashing, 6 lb., heavy, two-handed.*

## Uncommon

**Charged Slash.** As part of the Attack action or when you make an opportunity attack you can forgo an attack with this weapon in order to grant the weapon 1 charge (3 max). Charges are lost if not used within 1 minute.

When you make an attack roll while the weapon has any charges, all charges are expended and that attack is made with advantage; you can forgo this advantage and all other advantages you gain on this turn to gain 1 extra charge to expend on this attack.

On hit the weapon deals an extra 1d6 + your Strength modifier as weapon damage + the weapon's extra damage material (if it has one) for each charge expended in this way, plus an extra 3 damage if you expended 2 charges, or 6 damage if you expended 3 charges.

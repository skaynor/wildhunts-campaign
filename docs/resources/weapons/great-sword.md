# Great Sword

*Martial Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Greatsword  
**Compatible Weapon Mastery:** Graze

*A slow, heavy weapon with massive damage potential, the Greatsword is the heavy artillery of melee weapons. While simple at first, the Greatsword requires skilled timing and spacing in order to get the most out of it. On offense, the Greatsword attacks with slow, ponderous swings that hit with precision and accuracy.*

## Nonmagical

*50 gp, 2d6 slashing, 6 lb., heavy, two-handed.*

## Uncommon

**Charged Slash.** As part of the Attack action or when you make an opportunity attack you can forgo an attack with this weapon in order to grant the weapon 1 charge (3 max). Charges are lost if not used within 1 minute.

When you make an attack roll while the weapon has any charges, all charges are expended and that attack is made with advantage; you can forgo this advantage and all other advantages you gain on this turn to gain 1 extra charge to expend on this attack.

On hit the weapon deals an extra 1d6 + your Strength modifier as weapon damage + the weapon's extra damage material (if it has one) for each charge expended in this way, plus an extra 3 damage if you expended 2 charges, or 6 damage if you expended 3 charges.

## Rare

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

This weapon retains all previous rarities weapon properties in addition to the following:

**Guard.** As a reaction, you add 2 AC against one melee attack that would hit you. To do so, you must see the attacker and be wielding the greatsword. You have disadvantage on attacks until the end of your next turn.

## Very Rare

**Charged Slash Upgrade.** Your charge slash now deals an extra 1d8 + your Strength modifier as weapon damage + the weapon's extra damage material (if it has one) for each charge expended in this way, plus an extra 3 damage if you expended 2 charges, or 6 damage if you expended 3 charges.

**Guard Upgrade.** You now gain a +3 bonus to your AC when you use this reaction and you no longer have disadvantage on attacks until the end of your next turn.

**Dragonpiercer.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to fire a dragonpiercer, striking all creatures in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to your *Coating save DC*, taking 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If a creature is Huge or larger, it takes double damage. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

:::tip Coatings
Characters are not supposed to have an infinite amount of coatings or ammunition available to them, they should be bought at a price that the GM sees fit.

A flask of coating weighs the same as a flask of oil by default, and a holster of ammunition weighs the same as a bag of ball bearings.

Generally speaking a character should not have more than a dozen flasks of a coating, or holsters of ammunition.

# Wyvern Kunai

*Simple Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Dagger, Any weapon with the Thrown property

*Wyvern Kunai are balanced throwing blades designed to be gripped between the knuckles like clawed talons.*

## All Rarities

**Unlimited Knives.** You carry a magical pouch weighing 10 pounds that produces wyvern kunai. You can use an action or item interaction to draw one kunai from it or a bonus action to draw up to three kunai, all of which are held in the same hand. You can hold up to six kunai, which vanish if you stop holding them. Drawing kunai into a hand causes any kunai already in that hand to vanish. When a kunai is used to make a ranged weapon attack, it vanishes immediately after the attack hits or misses.

**Coating save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier or your Strength modifier.

## Nonmagical

*1d4 piercing; finesse, light, thrown (20/60). For each kunai.*

## Uncommon

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

**Coat Kunai.** As part of the bonus action used to draw a set of kunai, you can coat them in one of the following special oils (these oils don’t count against weapon rules found in Amellwind’s Guide to Monster Hunting, p. 79). A coating applies to all kunai drawn with that bonus action.

- *Decay.* Your weapon deals an extra 1d4 poison damage.
- *Dragon.* Your weapon deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage.
- *Electric.* Your weapon deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage.
- *Explosive.* Your weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage.
- *Frost.* Your weapon deals an extra 1d4 cold.
- *Sonic.* Your weapon deals an extra 1d4 thunder damage.

## Rare

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

This weapon retains all previous rarities weapon properties in addition to the following:

**Impaling Kunai.** When you hit a creature with a kunai, you can choose for the kunai to remain impaled in the target instead of vanishing. An impaled kunai remains embedded until the creature uses an action to remove it by succeeding on a Strength saving throw against your Coating Save DC. If the creature can make multiple attacks on its turn, it can replace one of those attacks to attempt this save instead.

**Coating Upgrades.** Your coatings gain the following effects:

- *Decay.* When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target is poisoned while it has at least one decay-coated kunai impaled in it.
- *Dragon.* When you hit a creature or a space with a dragon-coated kunai, you can use your bonus action to release a cloud of black smoke that heavily obscures the kunai’s space. The cloud fills a 5-foot cube centered on the kunai for 1 minute, or until the kunai is removed or vanishes.
- *Electric.* When you coat a set of kunai, your weapon’s reach increases to 10 feet until the start of your next turn. While you are holding at least one electric-coated kunai, you can use a bonus action on your subsequent turns to increase your weapon’s reach to 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
- *Explosive.* You can throw an explosive-coated kunai at a space within your weapon’s range. The kunai remains in that space until you draw a new set of kunai into the hand it was thrown from or until a creature enters the kunai’s space. When a creature enters the space, the kunai detonates and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Coating Save DC, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- *Frost.* A creature’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet for each frost-coated kunai impaled in it, up to a maximum reduction of 15 feet.
- *Sonic.* You can use your action to teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to a creature within 20 feet of you that has a sonic-coated kunai impaled in it. You can use this property twice, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

## Very Rare

*You gain a +2 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

This weapon retains all previous rarities weapon properties in addition to the following:

**Silkbound Knives.** When you draw a set of kunai, instead of coating them with an oil, you can attach a strand of wirebug silk to each kunai. When you hit a creature with a silkbound kunai, you can use your bonus action to pull the creature up to 20 feet straight toward you into an unoccupied space. If the creature is Huge or larger, it instead moves up to 10 feet.

**Coating Upgrade.** The coatings gain the following upgrades.

- *Decay.* A poisoned creature takes 1d4 poison damage at the start of each of its turns while it has at least one decay- coated kunai impaled in it.
- *Dragon.* The cloud of black smoke lightly obscures the area within 5 feet of the kunai in addition to heavily obscuring the kunai’s space.
- *Explosive.* You can use a bonus action to detonate any number of explosive-coated kunai impaled in a creature. The creature automatically fails its saving throw against these explosions. Each kunai can be detonated only once.
- *Sonic.* When you teleport using your sonic coating, you can make one melee weapon attack immediately after you appear in your new location.

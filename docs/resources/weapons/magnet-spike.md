# Magnet Spike

*Martial Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Greatsword, Maul

*This weapon is a heavy, melee type weapon with the ability to switch between two different weapon modes: A Slashing mode and an Impact mode. The key aspect of the weapon is its magnetism abilities. Naturally being a large, heavy weapon, it would be difficult to even handle or use in combat, but by manipulating the magnetic force in the weapon most of the weight is lifted, it becomes possible to move so fast that it would otherwise be deemed unnatural.*

## All Rarities

**Switch Mode.** As a bonus action, can change the damage type of this weapon from bludgeoning to slashing or vice versa.

**Magnetic Field Gun.** As part of your Attack action, you can fire a magnetic sphere at a creature or object. Make a special range weapon attack (range 30/120 ft.) using your Strength or Dexterity. On hit, the target takes 2d4 piercing damage and the magnetic sphere affixes itself to the target for 1 minute, until you recall it as a bonus action, or the target dies or is destroyed. If youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

**Magnetic Boost.** A creature or object hit by this weapon is magnetized for 1 minute or until you attack a new target. While magnetized, this weapon's damage die is increased by 1 size each time you hit the magnetized target (up to a d8).

**Magnetic Field Assault Upgrade.** You can now use a bonus action to pull yourself into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a creature wearing metallic armor.

**Magnetic Force Evade Upgrade.** When this movement causes you to remain in the creature's attack range, the attack is made at disadvantage.

**Magnetic Bind.** When you are within 5 feet of a target affixed with a magnetic sphere, you can use an action to bind the target inside a strong magnetic field. The target must make a Constitution saving throw equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus or be incapacitated and have its movement speed reduced to 0 for 1 minute.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over magnetic field, or the effect ends. Also, the target can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends.

Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

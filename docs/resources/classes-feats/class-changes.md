# Class Changes

In the Monster Hunter video game series, you are basically a powerful warrior, with no magical ability, that swings around a giant sword or fires arrows at the creature you are hunting.

That is not the case in this campaign. While you still have the option to swing around a giant sword; magical abilities, advanced technology, and space travel are all equally parts of this world. However, some of the mechanics don't translate as well without a few tweaks. This section will go over the changes made to the classes and their abilities.

## The Artificer

The artificer is a special case when it comes to the rule set found within this guide. As an artificer levels up, they gain the ability to attune to additional magical items. The balance of this system does not account for the monster parts system, so instead of an artificer gaining the ability to attune to additional magical items, they instead are given one additional material slot in both their armor and weapons at the 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Artificer Infusions

Artificer infusions are a special material that can be placed into a creature's armor, weapon, or trinket. These infusion materials are considered temporary and can be placed in slot(s) during a long rest. The slot can be empty or already contain a normal material. If it is placed in a slot with a normal material already in it, then the infusion material replaces it as the active material (but it does not destroy the normal material). The infusion material remains in the slot until it is removed during a long rest, the artificer no long knows the infusion, or the artificer is no longer apart of the hunting party.

If an infusion material requires attunement, then being attuned to the armor or weapon counts towards the attunement requirement for it with one condition. If the artificer places an infusion material into another creature's armor or weapon and it requires attunement, then the infusion takes up two slots instead of one. When an artificer places an infusion material that requires attunement into its own armor or weapon, it takes only one slot.

## The Druid

### Druid Wildshapes

Druids may want to make use of some of the beasts found in the Monster Hunter Monster Manual. If the DM allows this, the druid can choose any beast that doesn't have an action that causes the blinded, incapacitated, or paralyzed conditions. The druid also cannot use a beasts action that summons additional creature's to its aid.

Alternatively, a DM can allow the druid to choose creatures whose actions cause these conditions. If so, once the creature succeeds on a saving throw against a condition caused by the druid's wildshape, that creature is immune to that condition from the wildshape's actions for 24 hours.

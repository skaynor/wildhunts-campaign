# Carving & Capturing

Obtaining materials to upgrade your weapon and armor is a core part of Monster Hunter. The 2 most common ways to obtain material for you is carving materials off your kills or capturing larger creatures in the field. Occasionally a hunter may get lucky and come across a discard material in the field, possibly from a creature shedding, or what was left over from another creature's kill. There is rumored to be a tradesman that travels from location to location that offers materials for a price.

## Carving

Carving your kills is one of 2 ways to obtain materials while on a hunt. When you attempt to carve a creature, make a Dexterity (Survival) check against the creatures Carve DC. On a success, roll a d20 and compare the results to the creatures loot table. On a failed save, treat the roll as if they rolled a 1 on the loot table.

**Carve DC** = 10 + 1/2 of the creatures CR rounded down

### Variant Carve Rule: Rewarding the natural 20

When you roll a natural 20 on a Carve check, you roll an additional d20 and add that number to the loot table roll. The new number is the material found on that carve check.

*Any total higher than 20, counts as if a 20 was rolled.*

## Capturing

Certain creatures can be captured. A creature that can be captured will have a captured section of their loot table. A captured creature may provide loot that you are unable to obtain, an increased or decreased chance to obtain certain loot that you may have gotten from carving. When you capture a creature, you obtain a number of materials as labeled in the creatures loot table. No check is made, but the material is not gathered until you return to town.

### Tranq Bomb Rules

> As an action, you can throw this bomb up to 40 feet, releasing a tranquilizing gas on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the tranq bomb as an improvised weapon. On a hit, roll 5d8. If the target is below one-fourth of its maximum hit points and its remaining hits points are below the number rolled, it falls unconscious for 24 hours.  
> You can hit a creature with up to three tranq bombs or ammo. Adding the total of each tranq bomb or ammo together. If the creature does not fall unconscious after a third tranq bomb or ammo, it becomes immune to their effect for 24 hours.  
> A creature that does not have a capture loot table, is immune to tranq bombs or ammo effect.

:::tip 
At the beginning of the campaign you will not know what the loot tables are for each creature. The more you play and learn of the world you will learn the loot tables of more and more creatures. (Either through trial and error or help from researchers you meet).

## Shops

There is a wide variety for shops in monster hunter, the most common of them are the Provision Stockpile, the Smithy, and the General Store. There are also traveling merchants that appear on occasion offering an assortment of items.

### The Provision Stockpile

The provision stockpile appears in almost all cities, towns, and villages. Typically found within a guild hall and run by a guild receptionist. Characters that do not belong to the hunter's guild cannot purchase from the Provision Stockpile.

### The General Store

The general store has all your basic lifestyle and hunter needs. Here you will find a variety of items, tools, and trinkets any person may use in their life along with a few standard items for hunting. Below are some of the items you may find in a general store.

### Traveling Merchants

Traveling Merchants are vendors who randomly visit towns for one day before heading off to their next destination. Their inventory is an assortment of random items, typically between 5-10 items. These can range from typical general store items to rarer monster materials. When a traveling merchant arrives it is up to the GM to determine what they might be selling.

If the traveling merchant is selling monster materials, the price of the material can roughly be determined by the creatures CR as shown on the table below.

#### Material Base Price

| Creatures CR level | Base Price |
| :-:                | :-:        |
| 0-3                | 100 gp     |
| 4-8                | 400 gp     |
| 9-13               | 2000 gp    |
| 14-19              | 8,000 gp   |
| 20+                | 20,000 gp  |

### The Smithy

A workshop designed to answer all equipment-related needs, the Smithy may be the most vital of facilities for any hunter. At the Smithy, hunters can not only purchase new weapons and armor, but they can upgrade their existing weapons and armor, allowing them to place additional creature materials into them. The Smithy also acts as a standard blacksmith for those around the town, providing them with items for everyday use.

### Ammo Vendor

An ammo vendor may be located in a general store, near a blacksmith, or perhaps they have their own shop. A store may have a large supply of ammunition types or just a few of your DMs choice.

## Combo List

Many of the items found in the Monster Hunter Universe can be crafted using resources and materials found during your travels. Below you will find lists of items you can make with each tool, the required ingredients, how difficult it will be to make, and how much is created on a successful crafting check.

An item may appear more than once on any given list, requiring a different combination of items to craft. An item may also appear under two or more tools, in which case you may choose which tool you use to craft it.

### Using the Combo List

Any PC can create any of the items in the combo list so long as they have the tool required. **They do not need to be proficient with the tool.**

To craft an item from the combo list, the PC chooses the item they wish to create. So long as they have the tool, the required items, and enough time *(determined by the DM)* to create the item; then the PC makes a crafting check.

**Crafting Check:** 1d20 + your ability score modifier + your proficiency bonus *(if they are proficient with the tool)*.

On a successful crafting check, the required items are consumed and the item is crafted. If the crafting check fails by 5 or less, only 1 of the required items (PC's choice) is consumed. If they fail the check by 6 or more, both required items are consumed.

### Not sure what Ability Score to Use?

Tools are not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. A player can make a case to their DM on which ability score to use, but sometimes a DM may not agree or might be unsure on which ability score to have the PC use. If you are unsure of what skill to use, both Wisdom or Intelligence are great options to use.

Wisdom can be viewed as experience or natural talent with the tool. Think of it like a baker who doesn't measure their ingredients for a cake and adapts the recipe to what they think it should be, and the cake still ends up tasting amazing. While Intelligence can be used for the PC's retained knowledge or ability to follow instructions. This is the baker who follows the exact directions and the cake comes out exactly as expected.

## Resources

Below you will find a list of items a character can obtain from
gathering resources while on a hunt. These resources range
from bonepiles, to mushrooms. Many of them are crafting
materials that can be combined together with other
resources or monster materials to create useful items for you
on your adventurers.

While some resources may be used for crafting, some also
have other uses or effects that can be found in the details/use
section of the resource. Finally some resources are just rare
and sought after. These can typically be sold to the research
fleet if nobody else is willing to buy them.

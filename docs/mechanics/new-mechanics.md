# New Mechanics

Monster Hunter 5e adds new mechanics both in and out of combat to facilitate the experience of actually hunting a monster. Most of your encounters will happen during hunts in which you are trying to kill or capture a monster for a quest from the Hunter's Guild.

Additionally, methods for gathering and using resources gathered from these hunts are added to further customize and raise the power of your character.

New downtime activities have been added to fill in the time between hunts, and while most of this time will also be used for progressing the story of the campaign, your character  can take use of these activities as long as they are in an area with resources to support them.

Since the reemergence after the Great Dragon War a thousand years ago, the races of the world crawled back from extinction. Even with the slow advancements of technology, twelve of the races left their mark in the Old World. Working together with each other, under the guidance of the Platinum Court and Wild Lords, these races set out to become the society we have today. This section stands as a resource to help inspire you in deciding how your characterâ€™s racial background fits within the Monster
Hunter Universe.

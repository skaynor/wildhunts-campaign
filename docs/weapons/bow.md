:::tip Coatings
Characters are not supposed to have an infinite amount of coatings or ammunition available to them, they should be bought at a price that the GM sees fit.

A flask of coating weighs the same as a flask of oil by default, and a holster of ammunition weighs the same as a bag of ball bearings.

Generally speaking a character should not have more than a dozen flasks of a coating, or holsters of ammunition.

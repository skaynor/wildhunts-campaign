# Tonfas

*Martial or Simple Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Club, Flail, Handaxe, Light Hammer, Mace, Quarterstaff, Warhammer

*The Tonfa is made up of two light, swift poles with a propulsion system. Due to this, hunters can easily evade while the weapon is drawn and even propel themselves from the ground.*

## Nonmagical

*25 gp, 1d6 bludgeoning, 4 lb., light. For each Tonfa.*

## Uncommon

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.*

**Dragon Spirit.** When you attack a hostile creature with this weapon, you gain 1 spirit (maximum of 5). You lose all spirit, if you don't attack a target by the end of your next turn. You can expend spirit on the following weapon properties:

- *Earth Style.* As a bonus action, you can expend 2 spirit to increase your tonfas weapon damage die to a d8 until the end of your next turn.
- *Propel.* As a bonus action, you can expend 1 spirit to launch yourself 10 feet into the air. Until the end of your next turn you gain a fly speed of 10 feet (hover). You can't fly any higher than 10 feet above the ground from this property.

## Rare

*You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls; and +1 AC while wielding both tonfas.*

**Dragon Spirit Upgrade.** Your maximum spirit increases by 1 (maximum of 6) and you can expend your spirit on the following options in addition to all previous rarities options:

- *Propel Upgrade.* You no longer have a maximum height you can be above the ground with this property.
- *Air Dash.* When you are flying and a creature enters a space within your reach for the first time on a turn, you can use your reaction to expend 1 spirit and fly up to 10 feet away (without provoking opportunity attacks) from the creature.
- *Dragon Spirit Piercing Attack.* As an action, you can expend 6 spirit to quickly jab with both tonfas, sending a blast of tremendous force in a 15-foot line, that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency bonus, taking 2d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If a Huge or larger creature is in 10 feet or more of the line's area, the damage that creature takes is doubled. If youâ€™re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, the dragon spirit piercing attack replaces one of them. Once used, you can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Very Rare

*You gain a +2 bonus on attacks and damage rolls; and +1 AC while wielding both tonfas.*

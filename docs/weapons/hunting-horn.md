# Hunting Horn

*Martial Melee Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Musical Instrument, Maul, Warhammer

*The hunting horn is a blunt weapon that can bestow positive status effects on yourself and your allies. Use it to perform melodies that can boost attack power and grant other beneficial effects.*

## All Rarities

The hunting horn has a number of notes it is capable of playing depending on its rarity.

**Melody.** When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to elicit a number of notes (equal to your hunting horn's cord length) as a bonus action to form a melody. Notes with the same name, such as Attack Up (s) and Attack Up (m) can't be used in the same melody. Elemental damage also does not stack, but if multiple elemental damage notes are active, the player can choose the type of damage. The notes can be stored for 1 minute or until a melody is completed.

As an action you can complete the melody, providing the magical benefits of the notes in your melody to you, and all allies while they are within 20 feet of you and able to hear you. The melody lasts for 1 minute, until you complete a new melody, are knocked unconscious, or use a bonus action to end the current melody.

**Single Note Melody.** As an action you can slam the hunting horn into the ground to activate a single note melody. When you do, you and all allies that remain within 20 feet of you, gain the benefit of a note of your choice for 1 minute.

These Notes can come in the form of arcane runes, vibrating strings, or other objects. Once the character obtains a note, they can add/install it to their hunting horn during a long rest.

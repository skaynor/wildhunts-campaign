# Light Bowgun

*Simple Ranged Weapon*  
**Compatible Proficiency:** Light Crossbow

*The Light Bowgun is the smallest ranged weapon. It boasts the highest fire rate of the ranged weapons. It also specializes in supporting ammo, such as poison, paralysis and recovery, meaning it can reliably inflict a variety of status effects on the monster while still dealing damage.*

## All Rarities

**Rapid Fire.** Whenever you make an attack as part of the Attack action with the light bowgun, you make two attacks instead of one (*defaulting to normal ammo if you run out of any other type when attacking*).

**Overheat.** When you hit a creature with this weapon, the next attack you make with it only deals a maximum of 1d4 damage, in addition to any other effects from the ammo used for the attack. *This attack does not gain any extra damage from any other source, including ability score modifiers, bonus elemental damage, the sharpshooter feat, hunter's mark and spells like it, other spell effects, etc.* After making this attack, this property resets.

#### Examples of Four Attacks per Turn:
- **Hit** *(1d4+extra damage)* | **Hit** *(1d4)* | **Hit** *(1d4+extra damage)* | **Hit** *(1d4)*
- **Miss** (0) | **Hit** *(1d4+extra damage)* | **Hit** *(1d4)* | **Hit** *(1d4+extra damage)*
- **Miss** (0) | **Hit** *(1d4+extra damage)* | **Miss** (0) | **Hit** *(1d4+extra damage)*

**Ammo.** Your ammo is stored in an ammo pouch that weighs 10 lbs. The pouch can hold a certain amount of each type of ammo as shown in the Vendor table below. All ammo deal normal weapon damage unless otherwise specified. Some of your ammo require your target to make a saving throw to resist the ammoâ€™s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ammo save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

**Loading.** As a bonus action you switch the ammo your bowgun is using with another. *This replaces the standard 5e loading property.*

### Variant: Crafting Ammunition

You can craft ammunition to produce for your Bowgun. At the end of each long rest, you can create 20 rounds of ammunition. After each short rest, you can produce 5 rounds. It takes 3 rounds of ammunition when you craft any single round of ammunition that has a maximum capacity below 20.

It is uncommon for half-elves raised in human communities to leave their families behind. Most stay to inherit family trades, join local administrations, or find work in respected fields such as logistics, education, or commerce. Those who do feel the pull of something greater—an urge for movement, learning, or freedom—often find that urge satisfied through guilds, research teams, or long-range exploration contracts.</p></a></article><article class="col col--6 margin-bottom--lg"><a class="card padding--lg cardContainer_fWXF" href="/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/races/halflings"><h2 class="text--truncate cardTitle_rnsV" title="Halflings">📄️<!-- --> <!-- -->Halflings</h2><p class="text--truncate cardDescription_PWke" title="Halfling clans have long been recognized for their intense curiosity and habit of collecting anything that catches their eye.

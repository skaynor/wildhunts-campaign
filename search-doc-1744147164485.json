Worldbuilding-related character traits, such as race, background, and faction affiliation, are modified, but most individual mechanics remain unchanged. As with most 5e campaigns, magic is present in the world but it is uncommon for people, particularly hunters, to be exclusively spellcasters, and it is expected that you are also proficient in at least one hunter weapon.  Classes remain untouched (with a few exceptions), and while standard weapons exist, they are ineffective against the majority of creatures you will be facing. In their place, hunters utilize a set of specialized weapons, detailed further in this guide. The selection of your weapon is in some ways just as important as your class, as each enables you to unlock weapon-related feats and determine what materials you can use to augment your abilities. The extra stats provided by these weapon and armor changes allow you to properly take on the encounters in this campaign.  Homebrew Any and all homebrew is welcome, as long as you run it by the GM first. Much of this campaign and the systems are a work in progress and will be even during the duration of the campaign.

This guide assumes that you have chosen a faction and that you maintain your association with it throughout your life. As a result, your choice of faction can play a more significant role than most backgrounds do in shaping what your character does now.  The backgrounds associated with factions in this section work like those in the Player's Handbook, giving you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws). Each faction entry also provides personal contacts; suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a member of a spellcasting class.

Contacts​  Contacts are people you know. They might be a rival, a mentor, a friend, just another member of the faction or possibly a member of a different faction entirely. These contacts should be created with your DM and may provide additional depth for your character. When you create a character you have a number of contacts equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).  Renown​  Renown is your status in a faction. The higher your renown is, typically the more known and respected you are within the faction. It's also possible to gain renown in other factions, though this renown won't allow you to gain any ranks within the other factions.  To gain renown you must advance the guild’s agenda in some way. You will find in the Rank and Renown section of each faction, some suggestions that would merit an increase in your renown, but you should also check the goals of the faction to help determine other ways to gain renown. When you join a faction as a starting character, your renown score with that faction is 1. It is up to the DM when you gain renown, not the player.  There are other rules for gaining renown outside of the list above, but that can be found in The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica.  Benefits of Renown​  There are many benefits when you gain renown in a faction, most often it is tied to an increase in rank within the faction you are in, but not all are guild specific such as the two below:  Renown 3 or Higher. You have established yourself as a respected member of the guild and as such, the guild members are friendly to you by default (though some members might have a reason to dislike you).  Renown 5 or Higher. You gain another contact. This might be a member of your faction, or perhaps someone else you met on your adventures.  Losing Renown​  If you go against your faction, or commit a crime against society or nature, you might lose renown. It is up to the DM to determine how much based on the offense. You cannot drop below 0 renown with a faction, but if your renown drops below the required amount for your rank, then you lose the rank and any benefits it gave you. It also may be much harder to obtain that rank again.  Changing Factions​  If for some reason you chose to change factions, be it due to the narrative of the story, or some other reason, you then lose all renown with your previous faction and start with 0 renown with the new faction. The only exception with this is if you already gained renown with the new faction prior to joining them. Then instead you start with the renown you already had with them, though it may still take time for you to rise in the ranks.

The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks determined by the difficulty of the encounter. The chosen DC for medium is equal to the creature’s carve DC. A hard encounter is the creature’s carve DC +3 and deadly is the creature’s carve DC +6. Successful completion of the hunt yields a number of materials, as shown on the Loot Value table.  To attempt a Hunt, the character makes three checks: Wisdom (Perception), Intelligence (Investigation), and the player's choice of Wisdom (Survival), Dexterity (Stealth), or Strength (Athletics).  If none of the checks are successful, the character is severely injured and hospitalized. The injured character must spend one week in the hospital for every 50g of the initial cost of the hunt.

As a people, wood elves are largely seen as calm and level-headed.  Many hours of a typical wood elf's life are spent on the hunt, which was both a practical activity and a pleasurable one. Most of the time that wood elves were not hunting they were enjoying themselves at ease within the highest branches of their forest homes.

The drow were once high elves that worshiped the goddess Sune. When the goddess was corrupted she used her alluring whispers to convince her followers to ally with Fatalis in the Great Dragon War. After the Dark Mothers banishment to the Lower Planes, her high elf followers went into exile, hiding below the earth. As generations went by, the high elves blonde hair turned a silvery white, eyes blood red, and their once beautiful skin turned the color of ash. They took on a new name, no longer the high elves, but the drow servants of Lolth.  Drow, by reputation, were almost entirely evil. The drow society nominally had two purposes, called &quot;the First and Second Part of the Destiny of the People&quot;. The former was about forcing all other races of the Underdark into subservience, while the latter was about driving the entire elven population into extinction. To achieve this Lolth promoted perpetual infighting and violent competition, so that the constant training would make them stronger and smarter. However, the extreme, self-destructive degree to which this was taken prevented the drow from achieving either of their purposes, barring possibilities for significant growth. In fact, despite her rhetoric, Lolth merely enjoyed the infighting that she promoted and put no effort into reaching the supposed goals.  Drow rarely come to the surface, for most are too proud to return defeated to the sun-drenched lands of the Green Goddess, even to escape the madness of the underworld. Nevertheless, some still choose this dishonorable path. Those that travel to Riveru seeking redemption are executed before they enter the gates. The drow that return to their original homeland are welcomed by the wood elves, but only after renouncing Lolth and embracing Eldath once again. Others seek to join the Hunters Guild, as a way of atoning for their races' past sins by slaying the corruption that seeps into other creatures, like it did to their ancestors.

Molded by Eldath from those who worshiped the ukanlos that resided deep in the mountain range, the goliaths are a race wrapped in tradition. Their society's key focus was competitiveness and held equality and fairness in high regard. They kept track of their accomplishments and saw everything as a challenge. Many outside of the race that didn't understand this tradition would find it quite annoying when a goliath would bring up how many times a certain thing would happen. This was not the case however. To goliaths, score-keeping was a natural and integral part of life, not meant to belittle or demean anyone. Ancient goliaths lived in small tribes in the Snowy Mountains, that numbered between forty and sixty. This was usually made up of three to five extended families. Most goliaths lived in the same tribe their entire life. On rare occasions, a tribe that got too large would split into smaller tribes or smaller tribes would merge together. These tribes only went to war as a final option, and for much of the Great Dragon War they were successful in this endeavor. It wasn't until the death of their beloved ukanlos by the hands of the Dark Mother's cultists that they allied with the Aspects. The war was bloody for the goliaths, many of the families and tribes were wiped out. Those that survived returned to the Snowy Mountains beaten and bruised, but with a new found respect for their allies. After the reemergence, the goliaths were an integral part of the Pokke Village's founding. The Snowy Mountains had always been their home, and their knowledge of the territory prevented many casualties in those initial years. Though most goliath tribes are nomadic, many of them chose to remain in Pokke Village as gladiators, soldiers, and hunters. In fact, after the founding of the Hunters Guild in Pokke Village, the goliaths were one of the first to join up. The guild to them, represented the tradition that was lost after ukanlos' death. They were able to compete not only with their fellow goliaths, but also all the other members of the guild. Rumors in the past have told of goliath hunters returning to the Snowy Mountain with large pure white eggs. Though they deny it, many believe the goliaths are searching for a ukanlos egg, in hopes of returning on to the mountains once again.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Half-Elves","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/wildhunts-campaign/docs/resources/races/half-elves","content":"Half-Elves For a human, having a half-elf child was a blessing that brought their family closer to the gods.

Most of them take over family businesses or find a respectable job in town. Those that do feel the wanderlust from their elven heritage, usually join the Hunters Guild or Wycademy as a way to satiate that need. For the elves, their opinions varied. The wood elves welcome the half-elves with arms wide open, sharing their traditions and knowledge. The high elves of Riveru are not so accepting, the half-elves in their eyes are tainted. Their innate magic and ancestry are weakened by the human blood flowing within them, but that isn't to say that the half-elves have their uses. half-elves in Riveru work as house servants and doing other menial tasks in the town. It is a tough life, that many half-elves choose to leave once they come of age, never to return to the city.

Ancient Civilization Researcher​  The Ancient Civilization was a once thriving civilization that mysteriously went extinct some centuries ago. You seek to earn the secrets that were lost when this advanced civilization fell. These researchers may spend their time deciphering scrolls in the depths of the Wycademy or travel the world seeking these ruins. Thanks to these researchers weapons with multiple modes and different types of ammunition for the bowguns has been discovered.  Endemic Researcher​  You choose to study endemic life. This refers broadly to all small lifeforms that inhabit an area. Some endemic life can be used to provide long lasting benefits to hunters on a hunt, or temporary effects that may help or hinder a creature that interacts with them. Your goal is to study these creatures, classifying new endemic life once you determine their effects as one of the following: Hunting Helpers, Ensnaring Life, Craft Creatures, Rare Creatures, Other.  Resource Researcher​  You choose to research into the natural materials the world provides, attempting to locate unknown resources or ways to make use of known materials (such as earth crystals, thunderbugs, popfish) in different ways. Those who focus on minerals are known as geologists; those who study plants are known as botanists; insects are known as entomologists; fish, ichthyologist; mushrooms, mycologist. If you don't specialize in one type of resource, you are known as a naturalist.  Monster Researcher​  Monster researchers are split into two different types. The zoologist studies known creatures by observing various species in their habitats, zoologists understand how animals behave in the wild. Their goal is to identify and monitor how different species interact within their ecosystem. This is particularly important as many species continues to transform various habitats.  A researcher who searches for and studies unknown, legendary, or extinct animals whose present existence is disputed or unsubstantiated is known as a cryptozoologist.

The Protectors and Troupers tribes joined the other races of the world in the fight against Fatalis and Tiamat. Those grimalkyne who become palicos or prowlers are typically from these two tribes. Finally the Plunderers tribe sought to scavenge the battlefields and other ruins of the world, gathering enough supplies to protect themselves.

Created when a cult of teostra, shunned by the gods for their power hungry nature, began experimenting in an attempt to ascend by themselves. After numerous failed attempts, their leader cried out to the gods every night, begging for an answer, until he finally received one. Unknowingly under the guidance of the newly manifested Fatalis, the cultist succeeded in their endeavor, but not before killing their beloved teostra and completing the ritual by injecting its blood into their veins. These first tieflings had a more bestial look similar to the teostra. They had a fiery coloration, thick horns that curve backwards, large fangs, and a tail that ended in a clump of fur. The males had long flowing red hair and a beard that resembled the teostra's flowing mane. Female tieflings' hair varied in length and the hair between their horns was varying shades of yellow. Though they had ascended, they had committed an unspeakable act. Killing an elder dragon during this point in history was tantamount to attacking one of the Five themselves. The tieflings were forced to live as outlanders in small communities, or as hermits, but their allure of ascension brought those who felt ignored by the gods to their ranks. The tieflings continued to experiment with other elder dragon blood on the humans that came to them, creating new tieflings of all different colors and abilities. Their continual killing of the elder dragons did not go unnoticed. The Fifth Aspect, Eldath, sensed the blasphemy and the growing threat of the tieflings. So with the help of the other 4 Aspects, the tieflings were banished to the Lower Planes and the ritual was lost to the ages. The tieflings did not return to the material plane until the Great Dragon War. Their time in the Lower Planes had changed their appearance to the commonly known demonic look of today. Many of the tieflings fought in the archdevils armies, but tieflings were no longer predisposed to evil or power hungry as they once were. Those that sought to defect took the chance to escape and fight on the side of the Platinum Court and Wild Lords, who allowed them to remain on the material plane after the war had ended. Although their evil ancestors could be many generations removed, the taint lingered. Tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people are uncomfortable around them, whether they are aware of the tiefling's unsavory ancestry or not. When these prejudices were put aside, the tieflings' cunning and personal allure, which made them excellent deceivers, also made them inspiring leaders. Members of other races find that once they demonstrate friendship and trust towards a tiefling, it would quickly be reciprocated in full.

During the War of the Ancients, the tritons suffered massive defeats and many were twisted by Fatalis’ offer of power, transforming them into sahuagins. It wasn't until Persana ascended to godhood that the tritons were finally able to push the sahuagins and other corrupt creatures back to the elemental plane of water. In the aftermath of the war the tritons were tasked by Persana to be the caretakers of the sea. So they began building some small settlements beside deep trenches and even some in other dangerous spots far from the land. That isn't to say that all triton's live so far from the other races. Many of them call Moga Village and many of the port towns across the Old World home. Many triton's that live among the other races work as dockhands, shipwrights, or merchants in the ports.

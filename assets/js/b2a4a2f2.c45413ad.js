The Snowy Mountains had always been their home, and their knowledge of the territory prevented many casualties in those initial years. Though most goliath tribes are nomadic, many of them chose to remain in Pokke Village as gladiators, soldiers, and hunters. In fact, after the founding of the Hunters Guild in Pokke Village, the goliaths were one of the first to join up. The guild to them, represented the tradition that was lost after ukanlos' death. They were able to compete not only with their fellow goliaths, but also all the other members of the guild. Rumors in the past have told of goliath hunters returning to the Snowy Mountain with large pure white eggs. Though they deny it, many believe the goliaths are searching for a ukanlos egg, in hopes of returning on to the mountains once again."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var a=n(6540);const i={},o=a.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);

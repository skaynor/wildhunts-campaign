Monster Hunter","description":"There are many factions in the Monster Hunter Universe. Some of them make up the foundation of society, while others seek to destroy it. Many of these factions are voluntary associations led by guildmasters, but that\u2019s the extent of their resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found in most Dungeons & Dragons worlds.","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"lore/factions/helix-commission":{"id":"lore/factions/helix-commission","title":"Helix Commission","description":"In the world, there is an organization shrouded in secrecy known as the Helix Commission. The origins of this group are unknown, but some believe it was created by a faction of Wycademy researchers and royal scriveners who discovered an ancient incomplete Equal Dragon Weapon in the ruins of an ancient civilization research lab. It has been said that a few lead scientists and researchers within this faction became interested in following in the footsteps of the ancient civilization and began experimenting with creating hybrids of monsters. However, their requests to conduct this research were denied by the leaders of the ruling factions, who wished to keep this information secret.","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"lore/factions/hunters-guild":{"id":"lore/factions/hunters-guild","title":"Hunter\'s Guild","description":"The Hunter\'s Guild is the central governing body within the Monster Hunter universe. The Hunter\'s Guild unifies and regulates all hunting activities on which many people make their living. The guild aggregates hunting and gathering requests from far and wide, and posts them within their gathering halls and outposts throughout the land for professional hunters to undertake. These \\"quests\\" can have many purposes, including defense of citizens or towns, or research into monster anatomy and biology. The Hunter\'s Guild is also well-known for preventing poaching. Any unsanctioned hunting is illegal to the Hunter\'s Guild and can lead to a multitude of punishments, but most commonly death at the hand of a Guild Knight.","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"lore/factions/other-factions":{"id":"lore/factions/other-factions","title":"Other Factions and Backgrounds","description":"In addition to all of the custom factions and backgrounds, you are free to pick any of the backgrounds present in standard 5e or even homebrew your own.

Their work involves collecting and analyzing fossils, reconstructing the skeletal structures of monsters, and piecing together the evolutionary history of these creatures. They use their knowledge to inform the wider community about the behaviors, habitats, and weaknesses of these monsters, providing valuable insights that can help hunters take on new challenges in the field. The Royal Paleontology Scriveners are an essential part of the wider research community, and their work helps to deepen our understanding of the world and its inhabitants.","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"lore/factions/talon-society":{"id":"lore/factions/talon-society","title":"Talon Society","description":"The Talon Society is a secretive organization of poachers who are known to specialize in hunting rare and exotic creatures. They operate in the shadows, avoiding the authorities and conducting their illegal activities under the cover of darkness. They are motivated by profit and are willing to go to great lengths to secure valuable trophies, which can fetch high prices on the black market. They are skilled hunters and trackers, often employing traps and other means to capture their prey alive. The Talon members are notorious for their disregard of wildlife conservation and have been known to cause significant damage to the ecosystem. Despite the risks involved in their line of work, membership in the society is highly sought after, as it offers lucrative rewards and the chance to become one of the most successful poachers in the land.","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"lore/factions/wycademy":{"id":"lore/factions/wycademy","title":"Wycademy","description":"Long ago, the village of Bherna was visited by the Royal Scribes of Paleontology. During the visit, it was discovered the limestone formations around the village contained quantities of fossils of monsters and plants extinct today. From the Royal Paleontology Scriveners investigation and report, the scribes dispatched a small group to set up camp. Over the years scholars focused on laboratory work, leaving field work to hunters, and giving rise to the Wycademy.","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"lore/intro":{"id":"lore/intro","title":"The World","description":"Themed around Citizen Sleeper","sidebar":"loreSidebar"},"players/intro":{"id":"players/intro","title":"Your team","description":"Internal links to everyone\'s pages","sidebar":"playersSidebar"},"resources/appendix/artisan-recipe-table":{"id":"resources/appendix/artisan-recipe-table","title":"Artisan Recipe Table","description":"Rank 1","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/appendix/finding-signs-table":{"id":"resources/appendix/finding-signs-table","title":"Finding Signs Table","description":"Whenever the trailblazer rolls a Survival check for entering an area, the GM rolls on the table below to determine what signs, challenges, or benefits they may find in the area.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/appendix/solo-hunt-table":{"id":"resources/appendix/solo-hunt-table","title":"Solo Hunt Table","description":"| Character Level | Medium Encounter | Hard Encounter | Deadly Encounter |","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/appendix/trenya-loot-table":{"id":"resources/appendix/trenya-loot-table","title":"Trenya Loot Table","description":"200gp Adventures (DC 12)","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/appendix/weapon-armor-pricing":{"id":"resources/appendix/weapon-armor-pricing","title":"Armor and Weapon Pricing","description":"| Weapons          | Cost  | Damage                                       | AC  | Weight | Properties |","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/classes-feats/class-changes":{"id":"resources/classes-feats/class-changes","title":"Class Changes","description":"In the Monster Hunter video game series, you are basically a powerful warrior, with no magical ability, that swings around a giant sword or fires arrows at the creature you are hunting.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/classes-feats/new-feats":{"id":"resources/classes-feats/new-feats","title":"New Feats","description":"Feats can be an important part of Dungeons and Dragons and should your Dungeon Master allow them, here are a few new additional feats you are able to choose from.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/intro":{"id":"resources/intro","title":"How to Hunt a Monster","description":"This is a brief summary of the portions of Guide to Monster Hunting by Amellwind used in the Preyline campaign.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/mechanics/carving-capturing":{"id":"resources/mechanics/carving-capturing","title":"Carving & Capturing","description":"Obtaining materials to upgrade your weapon and armor is a core part of Monster Hunter.

Dragonborn blood carries the genetic memory of these creatures: elemental breath, resilient flesh, and instinctual dominance. Though stable, they are still mutative. Some Dragonborn develop changes across generations; others awaken one day with a new scale pattern, a second heartbeat, or fragmented visions of burning planets.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/dwarves":{"id":"resources/races/dwarves","title":"Dwarves","description":"The bold and enduring dwarves of the old world are renowned for their skill in metallurgy, engineering, and heavy labor\u2014traits honed through centuries of life carved into stone and steel. While many trace their roots back to a singular industrial stronghold buried in the western ranges, dwarven culture has spread widely across the fractured settlements of the world. Their ancestral foundries and subterranean halls remain symbols of their enduring craftsmanship, though in recent generations, they have shared these spaces with allied kin\u2014most notably the troverians. Through this collaboration, dwarves have advanced numerous breakthroughs in survival gear, modular tools, and structural reinforcement that remain essential to frontier life.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/elves":{"id":"resources/races/elves","title":"Elves","description":"Elves are considered one of the oldest surviving peoples from before the fall of civilization\u2014descendants of those who first aligned themselves with the planet\u2019s natural systems rather than its machines. Designed or adapted to thrive in organic environments, elves developed cultures that emphasized long-term thinking, sustainability, and a deep understanding of biological and ecological processes. Many still live in reclaimed wilderness zones, maintaining isolated communities that blend seamlessly with their surroundings. Others, however, abandoned the forests long ago in favor of ordered settlements and structured study. This cultural split created lasting tension, but also innovation. Wherever they settle, elves are known for their precision, quiet intensity, and a mindset shaped by centuries of memory. Whether in the depths of the overgrowth or the towers of the rebuilt world, they remain watchful stewards of both past and future.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/gnomes":{"id":"resources/races/gnomes","title":"Gnomes","description":"Gnomes and their vibrant culture were once a cornerstone of daily life during the height of the ancient civilizations. Their presence could be felt everywhere\u2014no settlement was without the hum of spinning mechanisms, the sudden crack of a misfired prototype, or the sound of excited chatter followed by raucous laughter. Gnomes were widely celebrated for their endless creativity, contributing countless innovations in engineering, energy systems, and microtech design. Though their numbers dwindled after society\u2019s collapse, remnants of their brilliance endure. Towering archives buried deep in the eastern zones and a partially intact orbital corridor station off the coast remain as gleaming\u2014if half-functioning\u2014reminders of a time when the gnomes helped shape the future with every spark, screw, and miscalculated blast.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/goliaths":{"id":"resources/races/goliaths","title":"Goliaths","description":"One of the last known sentient species to emerge before the collapse of the old world, the goliaths are a people shaped by the snowbound extremes of the high mountain ranges. Their culture was born from reverence\u2014not toward gods, but toward the colossal, ancient lifeforms that once roamed the glacial valleys. Goliaths are deeply traditional, valuing personal challenge, communal strength, and fairness above all else. They keep meticulous records of accomplishments, not to boast, but to track growth, resolve disputes, and honor the memory of those who came before. To outsiders unfamiliar with this custom, their constant score-keeping can seem irritating, but to a goliath, it is simply a way of life.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/half-elves":{"id":"resources/races/half-elves","title":"Half-Elves","description":"For many humans, having a half-elf child is seen as a rare and welcome event\u2014something that brings prestige, admiration, or even a sense of elevated status within their community. These children often grow up surrounded by affection and high expectations, raised with the belief that they represent a bridge between peoples. It is uncommon for half-elves raised in human communities to leave their families behind. Most stay to inherit family trades, join local administrations, or find work in respected fields such as logistics, education, or commerce. Those who do feel the pull of something greater\u2014an urge for movement, learning, or freedom\u2014often find that urge satisfied through guilds, research teams, or long-range exploration contracts.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/halflings":{"id":"resources/races/halflings","title":"Halflings","description":"Halfling clans have long been recognized for their intense curiosity and habit of collecting anything that catches their eye. In the era before the collapse of the old civilizations, they were foremost experts in the study of plant life, fungi, and natural compounds. Their small size and sharp senses made them ideal field researchers and herbalists, leading expeditions into remote, often dangerous zones to gather rare biological materials. Their work wasn\u2019t just for academic interest\u2014it frequently contributed to medicine, environmental restoration, and the enhancement of life for both organic and synthetic beings.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/humans":{"id":"resources/races/humans","title":"Humans","description":"During the time of the ancient civilizations, human societies were widespread across the known world. Known for their versatility and adaptability, humans quickly learned to coexist with other species, often without conflict. Even after the collapse of those great societies, humans endured\u2014reshaped by generations of exposure to unstable environments, lost technologies, and the realities of a fractured world. Today, humans are found in nearly every settlement, taking on roles in trade, logistics, infrastructure, and production. Many are skilled artisans, merchants, or engineers, helping to keep the machinery of society running. Others seek lives beyond the bounds of civilization, joining research guilds, exploration crews, or independent hunting parties as field technicians, handlers, or archaeologists. Their communities often serve as hubs for communication and commerce, connecting scattered regions across the world through practical labor and restless ambition.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/lynians":{"id":"resources/races/lynians","title":"Lynians","description":"Lynians are a relatively common species known for their adaptability and resilience, often compared to that of humans. Though many subspecies originated from a single continental cradle, they have since spread across a wide range of environments\u2014arid surface colonies, deep substructure warrens, orbital stations, and reclaimed settlements alike. Their physical form, marked by short stature and beast-like features, allows them to navigate areas and perform tasks that larger-bodied species struggle with.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/other-races":{"id":"resources/races/other-races","title":"Other Races","description":"Countless other sentient species exist across the known world, many with roots stretching back to the age of the ancient civilization. Some fought beside humanity and the other core races in forgotten conflicts, while others opposed them or simply endured in isolation. Their origins are often obscured by time\u2014lost to fractured records, genetic drift, or ideological myth\u2014but their cultures and core identities remain intact. How they rose, adapted, or influenced the world is left to interpretation, but their personalities, societal roles, and interactions often mirror those found in more traditional accounts. Whether integrated into major settlements or surviving in the margins, these races are yours to shape\u2014and their pasts, like much of the world, are waiting to be rediscovered.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/race-introduction":{"id":"resources/races/race-introduction","title":"The Races of Monster Hunter","description":"This page contains updated flavor text for the races provided by the Guide to Monster Hunting, subsequent pages contain updated flavor text as well as any game stats for each race.

Power-hungry. Abominations. These are just a few of the names cast at the earliest tieflings\u2014humans whose pursuit of forbidden transformation set them apart from the rest of civilization. Long ago, a fringe group of bio-alchemists, obsessed with unlocking a higher form of life, began experimenting with the fusion of human physiology and unstable lifeforms. Their efforts were dismissed, banned, or ignored by most major institutions. But isolation did not stop them. Over time, their leader found success by pushing beyond ethical and biological boundaries, using volatile genetic material drawn from an apex predator of the era. The cost was irreversible.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/tritons":{"id":"resources/races/tritons","title":"Tritons","description":"Tritons are believed to be among the first humans to undergo a lasting transformation in response to the ocean\u2019s call\u2014altered not by machines, but by something deeper and older. Their physiology became attuned to the crushing depths and pressure zones of the sea, and over generations, they developed a natural command of aquatic environments. This legacy of transformation and duty has given many tritons an air of pride that is often mistaken for arrogance. In truth, most believe deeply in their responsibility to safeguard others, even if their sense of superiority can sometimes make that protection feel condescending.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/troverians":{"id":"resources/races/troverians","title":"Troverians","description":"Known in pre-collapse times as \u201cForgefoots,\u201d the people now called Troverians adopted their current name in the era of rediscovery. Unlike dwarves\u2014who are often steeped in mythic origins\u2014Troverians are believed to have descended from early human settlers who adapted to deep, rugged environments. Generations spent beneath the surface or among isolated mountain colonies changed them physically and mentally. They developed resilient bodies, sharp instincts, and a deep connection to the mechanical and mineral worlds around them.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/warforged":{"id":"resources/races/warforged","title":"Warforged","description":"During the height of the ancient civilization, a new form of life was created\u2014not by divine will, but by human design.

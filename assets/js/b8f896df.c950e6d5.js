factions in the Monster Hunter Universe. Some of them make up the foundation of society, while others seek to destroy it. Many of these factions are voluntary associations led by guildmasters, but that\u2019s the extent of their resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found in most Dungeons & Dragons worlds.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/factions/helix-commission":{"id":"resources/factions/helix-commission","title":"Helix Commission","description":"In the world, there is an organization shrouded in secrecy known as the Helix Commission. The origins of this group are unknown, but some believe it was created by a faction of Wycademy researchers and royal scriveners who discovered an ancient incomplete Equal Dragon Weapon in the ruins of an ancient civilization research lab. It has been said that a few lead scientists and researchers within this faction became interested in following in the footsteps of the ancient civilization and began experimenting with creating hybrids of monsters. However, their requests to conduct this research were denied by the leaders of the ruling factions, who wished to keep this information secret.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/factions/hunters-guild":{"id":"resources/factions/hunters-guild","title":"Hunter\'s Guild","description":"The Hunter\'s Guild is the central governing body within the Monster Hunter universe. The Hunter\'s Guild unifies and regulates all hunting activities on which many people make their living. The guild aggregates hunting and gathering requests from far and wide, and posts them within their gathering halls and outposts throughout the land for professional hunters to undertake. These \\"quests\\" can have many purposes, including defense of citizens or towns, or research into monster anatomy and biology. The Hunter\'s Guild is also well-known for preventing poaching. Any unsanctioned hunting is illegal to the Hunter\'s Guild and can lead to a multitude of punishments, but most commonly death at the hand of a Guild Knight.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/factions/other-factions":{"id":"resources/factions/other-factions","title":"Other Factions and Backgrounds","description":"In addition to all of the custom factions and backgrounds, you are free to pick any of the backgrounds present in standard 5e or even homebrew your own.

Their work involves collecting and analyzing fossils, reconstructing the skeletal structures of monsters, and piecing together the evolutionary history of these creatures. They use their knowledge to inform the wider community about the behaviors, habitats, and weaknesses of these monsters, providing valuable insights that can help hunters take on new challenges in the field. The Royal Paleontology Scriveners are an essential part of the wider research community, and their work helps to deepen our understanding of the world and its inhabitants.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/factions/talon-society":{"id":"resources/factions/talon-society","title":"Talon Society","description":"The Talon Society is a secretive organization of poachers who are known to specialize in hunting rare and exotic creatures. They operate in the shadows, avoiding the authorities and conducting their illegal activities under the cover of darkness. They are motivated by profit and are willing to go to great lengths to secure valuable trophies, which can fetch high prices on the black market. They are skilled hunters and trackers, often employing traps and other means to capture their prey alive. The Talon members are notorious for their disregard of wildlife conservation and have been known to cause significant damage to the ecosystem. Despite the risks involved in their line of work, membership in the society is highly sought after, as it offers lucrative rewards and the chance to become one of the most successful poachers in the land.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/factions/wycademy":{"id":"resources/factions/wycademy","title":"Wycademy","description":"Long ago, the village of Bherna was visited by the Royal Scribes of Paleontology. During the visit, it was discovered the limestone formations around the village contained quantities of fossils of monsters and plants extinct today. From the Royal Paleontology Scriveners investigation and report, the scribes dispatched a small group to set up camp. Over the years scholars focused on laboratory work, leaving field work to hunters, and giving rise to the Wycademy.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/intro":{"id":"resources/intro","title":"How to Hunt a Monster","description":"This is a brief summary of the Guide to Monster Hunting by Amellwind.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/mechanics/carving-capturing":{"id":"resources/mechanics/carving-capturing","title":"Carving & Capturing","description":"Obtaining materials to upgrade your weapon and armor is a core part of Monster Hunter. The two most common ways to obtain materials are by carving materials off your kills or capturing larger creatures in the field. Occasionally, a hunter may get lucky and come across discarded material in the field, possibly from a creature\'s shedding or what was left over from another creature\'s kill. There is rumored to be a tradesman who travels from location to location and offers materials for a price.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/mechanics/downtime-activies":{"id":"resources/mechanics/downtime-activies","title":"Downtime Activities","description":"When you aren\'t out of quests or progressing the plot, there are plenty of new downtime activities to fill your time.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/mechanics/hunts":{"id":"resources/mechanics/hunts","title":"Hunts","description":"Your Role on a Hunt","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/mechanics/items":{"id":"resources/mechanics/items","title":"Monster Hunter Items","description":"For full tables of item effects and prices, magical item effects and prices, and shop inventories, please reference the Guide to Monster Hunting (pg.65-72)","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/mechanics/new-mechanics":{"id":"resources/mechanics/new-mechanics","title":"New Mechanics","description":"Monster Hunter 5e adds new mechanics both in and out of combat to facilitate the experience of actually hunting a monster. Most of your combat encounters will happen during hunts in which you are trying to kill or capture a monster for a quest from the Hunter\'s Guild.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/dragonborn":{"id":"resources/races/dragonborn","title":"Dragonborn","description":"In the time of the ancient civilization the dragonborn were known far and wide, as the most devout and honorable race of the time. The original dragonborn were known to be humans who had ascended, by the grace of Io, to a state of body and mind that closely resembled the original image of the Five. These dragonborn excelled at all they did, becoming great heroes, community leaders, head of clergies and other research institutions of the ancient civilization. By the end of the Great Dragon War, most of the dragonborn had been wiped out with many of the elder dragonborn bloodlines going extinct with their elder dragon brethren. After the reemergence dragonborns were a rare sight for villages and even some towns. Those that lived in cities were typically well respected noble families that could trace their heritage back to the ancient civilization. New dragonborns that weren\'t born from these families were almost unheard of. It was a rare occasion when a person of any race proved themselves worthy to an Aspect, and were granted the gift as a reward. In Tiamat\'s case, she lorded the ascension over her followers, only granting the gift to those who bring her priceless artifacts, great wealth, or progress her plans beyond her expectations. Those who fail her, or request the ascension, instead are typically turned into kobolds.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/dwarves":{"id":"resources/races/dwarves","title":"Dwarves","description":"The bold and hardy dwarves of the Old World are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Modeled by the All-Father after the reemergence almost every dwarf in the Old World originates from Harth, a village near the Everwoods (located west of the Old World). Harth itself still stands as the central heart of dwarven society, but in the last few hundred years they have welcomed the troverians into their home. Combining their crafts, the troverians and dwarves have made a dramatic impact on a hunter\'s quality of life. Mountain and hill dwarves alike can be found in the many cities and locales of the Old World, but typically in small numbers. Hill dwarves are known to make above ground settlements of their own. If drawn to more dangerous pursuits, many dwarves turn to mercenary work, working with the hunters guild and wycademy in search of ancient civilization artifacts.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/elves":{"id":"resources/races/elves","title":"Elves","description":"The elves were one of the first races created after the creation of the Old World. They were the first race to be created by Eldath meant to represent the beauty of nature. The elves originated in the wooded lands of the Verdant Hills, and many elves still call the forest their home. After the War of the Ancients, when the elves allied themselves with Eldath against Fatalis and its demonic horde, many of the high elf families did not return to the forest, instead choosing a new life in the city of Riveru. Even after the reemergence, Riveru was a wondrous thing of beauty. Many elven heroes and hunters originate from this city.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/gnomes":{"id":"resources/races/gnomes","title":"Gnomes","description":"The gnomes and gnomish culture were extremely prevalent during the time of the ancient civilization. There wasn\'t a village street or a city block where the sound of gears grinding, minor explosions, and yelps of surprise were mixed in with bursts of laughter and joy. The gnomes were responsible for many of the great innovations and inventions of the time. After the reemergence the ruins of the Tower to the far east and the Sky\'s Corridor on a remote island off the east coast of the great forest still stand as a testament to their work.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/goliaths":{"id":"resources/races/goliaths","title":"Goliaths","description":"One of the last races created by the gods before the Great Dragon War, the goliaths were outlanders who resided in the Snowy Mountains. Molded by Eldath from those who worshiped the ukanlos that resided deep in the mountain range, the goliaths are a race wrapped in tradition. Their society\'s key focus was competitiveness and held equality and fairness in high regard. They kept track of their accomplishments and saw everything as a challenge. Many outside of the race that didn\'t understand this tradition would find it quite annoying when a goliath would bring up how many times a certain thing would happen.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/half-elves":{"id":"resources/races/half-elves","title":"Half-Elves","description":"For a human, having a half-elf child was a blessing that brought their family closer to the gods. They grew up adored in their communities, growing up with acceptance and praise. It is uncommon for a half-elf to leave their families or communities when they come of age. Most of them take over family businesses or find a respectable job in town. Those that do feel the wanderlust from their elven heritage, usually join the Hunters Guild or Wycademy as a way to satiate that need.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/halflings":{"id":"resources/races/halflings","title":"Halflings","description":"Halfling clans have always been known for their curiosity and tendency to collect things. Before the War of the Ancients the halflings were the leading experts in botany and were most commonly herbalists. They lead expeditions across the world collecting plants, mushrooms, and other rare resources that they could study and use to better the life of the races and creatures alike.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/humans":{"id":"resources/races/humans","title":"Humans","description":"During the ancient times the human civilizations were widespread across the known world. They are diverse in skills and quick to adapt, which allowed them to learn and live with the other races without conflict. After the reemergence, the humans were recreated by the Aspect Pelor. With the Great Wheel infused with both divine and corruption, the Humans were made stronger, but their once good nature was now shaped by the world around them. Human hunters and folk heroes can originate from anywhere in the Old World and are typically found in all villages, cities, and towns. Most Commonly though, hunters that graduate from the hunter academy are from Minegarde or villages nearby in the Verdant Hills. Humans living in the Verdant hills provide the infrastructure for port and trade between the three largest cities; Dundorma, Verudo, and Riveru; and the rest of the world. As such, humans are typically skilled in some craft, business, or production. For the humans seeking a life away from civilization, more often than not find work with the wycademy or hunters guild as research explorers, archeologist, handlers, or hunters themselves.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/lynians":{"id":"resources/races/lynians","title":"Lynians","description":"The Lynians are a relatively common race in the Old World, able to adapt to their environments much like humans. Although many of the lynian subspecies originated on the main continent in the Old World many of them have migrated to all corners of the world. For those who stay within multispecies communities, their short stature and beast-like nature has always proved a social hindrance in the lands of the tall folk. While lynians fight for respect within human communities, they can prove themselves through deeds, or humor, among their taller neighbors. They\'ve been seen being farmers, traders, adventurers, etc. Some Lynians, known as \\"palicos\\", are known to assist hunters and quite a few are independent monster hunters, known as prowlers.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/other-races":{"id":"resources/races/other-races","title":"Other Races","description":"There are many other races that live within the Monster Hunter Universe. Many of these races fought alongside or against the humans, elves, and all the other races listed above in one of the two wars. Their origins all begin with being created by one god or another, and which one that created them might vary in your world. Their history and relevance to the ancient civilization are for you to choose, but typically their culture and personalities remain the same as they would in any standard dungeons and dragons campaign setting.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/race-introduction":{"id":"resources/races/race-introduction","title":"The Races of Monster Hunter","description":"This page contains the flavor text provided by the Guide to Monster Hunting, subsequent pages contain the flavor text provided by the guide as well as any game stats for each race.

Created when a cult of teostra, shunned by the gods for their power hungry nature, began experimenting in an attempt to ascend by themselves. After numerous failed attempts, their leader cried out to the gods every night, begging for an answer, until he finally received one. Unknowingly under the guidance of the newly manifested Fatalis, the cultist succeeded in their endeavor, but not before killing their beloved teostra and completing the ritual by injecting its blood into their veins.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/tritons":{"id":"resources/races/tritons","title":"Tritons","description":"The tritons were the first humans to worship the Fives creation and as such were infused with the power of the sea. Due to this, many tritons come across as arrogant, but they are in fact benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a ceadeus awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/troverians":{"id":"resources/races/troverians","title":"Troverians","description":"Known as the forgefoots in ancient times, the troverians took their new name after the reemergence. Unlike the dwarves who were molded by stone and minerals by the all-father, the troverians were born from humans who worshiped the creatures of the earth, and were the last to be ascended by Io before his sacrifice.","sidebar":"resourceSidebar"},"resources/races/warforged":{"id":"resources/races/warforged","title":"Warforged","description":"During the time of the ancient civilization a new race was created, not by the gods, but by man. These Equal Hunter Weapons or \\"EHWs\\" were created near the end of the ancient civilization as an attempt to meet the ancient civilizations\' needs.

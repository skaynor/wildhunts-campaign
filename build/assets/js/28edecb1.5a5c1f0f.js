Killing an elder dragon during this point in history was tantamount to attacking one of the Five themselves. The tieflings were forced to live as outlanders in small communities, or as hermits, but their allure of ascension brought those who felt ignored by the gods to their ranks. The tieflings continued to experiment with other elder dragon blood on the humans that came to them, creating new tieflings of all different colors and abilities. Their continual killing of the elder dragons did not go unnoticed. The Fifth Aspect, Eldath, sensed the blasphemy and the growing threat of the tieflings.
